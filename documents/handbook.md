---

### Commission Rates by Product/Service Category (Tiered)

| Product/Service Category | Commission Rate | Notes |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **New Fire Equipment Sales (New Customers / Projects +40,000 TND)** | **4%** | Fire extinguishers, hose reels, alarms, large equipment |
| **Fire Equipment Installation Projects** | **3%** | Installation contracts, complex projects |
| **Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMC)** | **6%** | Of first year annual value (paid on collection) |
| **PPE & Workwear Sales (New Customers / Projects +30,000 TND)** | **3%** | Lower-margin products |
| **Safety Signage (New Customers / Projects +20,000 TND)** | **3%** | Standard product category |
| **Spare Parts & Consumables (New Customers / Projects +15,000 TND)** | **2%** | Small transactions, lower priority |

---

### Commission Calculation Examples

**Example 1: New Equipment Sale**
- Customer orders 20 fire extinguishers + installation
- Total invoice: 15,000 TND
- Equipment (12,000 TND) × 4% = 480 TND
- Installation (3,000 TND) × 3% = 90 TND
- **Total Commission: 570 TND**
- **When Paid:** When customer pays invoice (if paid in 30 days, commission paid in Month 2)

**Example 2: Annual Maintenance Contract (3-Year)**
- 3-year AMC contract: Total value 30,000 TND (10,000 TND per year)
- Commission: 10,000 × 6% = 600 TND (on first year value)
- **Payment Schedule:**
  * If customer pays annually in advance: 600 TND when payment received
  * If customer pays monthly: 600 ÷ 12 = 50 TND per month as payments are received
  * Years 2-3: No additional commission (already paid on first-year value)

**Example 3: Mixed Sale**
- Customer order: 10 extinguishers (4,000 TND) + PPE supplies (2,000 TND) + Refilling service (500 TND)
- Equipment: 4,000 × 4% = 160 TND
- PPE: 2,000 × 3% = 60 TND
- Service: 500 × 2% = 10 TND
- **Total Commission: 230 TND**

---

### Commission Payment & Administration

- **Critical rule:** Commission paid when customer pays (not when sale is made)
- Monthly commission statement provided by the 10th of the month
- Commission amounts are paid with the salary on the 5th of the following month (subject to collection)
- Commission clawbacks: If product is returned or service cancelled, commissions are reversed and recovered from future payments
- Split Sales: If multiple reps contribute, commissions may be split (e.g., 70/30) — document agreement in WAVE PLUS
- Discounts: Sales reps may offer discounts up to **12.5%**; larger discounts require Sales Manager approval and can affect commission

- Sometimes people don't realize their behavior is offensive
- If unsafe or they're in position of power, skip to Step 2

**Step 2: Report Immediately To:**
- **Your manager** (if they're not involved in the situation)
- **Admin Manager (Mohamed Ali LENDA)** (any harassment issue)
- **Gérant (Karim BEN SALEM)** (serious issues or if others not responsive)
- Don't wait or hope it will stop on its own

**Step 3: Investigation**
- Company will investigate promptly (within 7-10 days)
- Confidential process (only those who need to know)
- Fair investigation (both sides heard)
- Evidence gathered objectively

**Step 4: Action**
- If harassment confirmed: Appropriate action taken
- May include: Warning, suspension, termination, reassignment
- Severity of action matches severity of offense

**Step 5: Protection**
- You will be protected from retaliation
- Any retaliation is separate violation (also disciplined)
- Confidentiality maintained to extent possible

---

**We Take This Seriously Because:**
- Harassment violates our core values (respect, professionalism)
- Creates unsafe, toxic work environment
- Harms individuals emotionally and professionally
- Illegal under Tunisia labor law
- Destroys team morale and productivity
- Will result in discipline up to immediate termination

**Your Responsibility:**
- Don't engage in harassment ever
- Report harassment if you witness it (protect your colleagues)
- Cooperate with investigations if asked
- Support victims (don't blame or ostracize)
- Maintain confidentiality of investigations

---

## 7.3 DISCIPLINE PROCESS

**Our Approach - Fair and Progressive:**

We believe in giving people opportunities to improve. If performance or behavior issues arise, we use progressive discipline (escalating steps). Purpose is to correct behavior, not punish.

**Progressive Discipline Steps:**

**STEP 1: Verbal Coaching (Informal)**
- **When:** First minor infraction or performance issue
- **Process:** Manager speaks with you privately, clarifies expectations, offers support
- **Documentation:** Manager keeps informal notes
- **Goal:** Quick correction before becomes pattern

**STEP 2: Verbal Warning (Formal)**
- **When:** Repeat of issue after coaching, OR moderate infraction
- **Process:** Formal meeting, documented, clear expectations set, consequences explained
- **Documentation:** Verbal warning form signed by both, in your personnel file
- **Goal:** Make clear this is serious, improvement required

**STEP 3: Written Warning**
- **When:** Repeat after verbal warning, OR serious infraction first time
- **Process:** Written warning letter detailing issue, history, expectations, timeline for improvement
- **Documentation:** Signed by both, copy to you, in personnel file
- **Consequences:** Further issues may lead to termination
- **Goal:** Final wake-up call, last chance to improve

**STEP 4: Final Written Warning / Suspension**
- **When:** Repeat after written warning, OR very serious infraction
- **Process:** Final warning issued, may include unpaid suspension (1-5 days)
- **Message:** This is your absolute last chance
- **Next Step:** Any further infraction = termination

**STEP 5: Termination**
- **When:** No improvement after final warning, OR gross misconduct
- **Process:** Employment ended with proper notice (unless gross misconduct)
- **Documentation:** Termination letter, final pay calculated

---

**Gross Misconduct = Immediate Termination (Skip Progressive Steps):**

**Serious Offenses That Result in Immediate Termination:**
- Theft (company property, customer property, colleague belongings)
- Fraud, embezzlement, or falsification of documents
- Violence, assault, or physical threats
- Sexual harassment or assault
- Working under influence of alcohol or drugs
- Bringing weapons to workplace
- Sabotage or intentional property destruction
- Revealing confidential information to competitors
- Criminal activity on company premises
- Serious breach of safety causing injury or imminent danger

**Process Even for Gross Misconduct:**
- Immediate suspension (pending investigation)
- Investigation conducted (fair process, hear your side)
- If confirmed: Immediate termination (no notice period required per labor code)
- Police involvement if criminal (theft, assault, etc.)

---

**Your Rights in Discipline Process:**
- Right to know what policy you violated (specific details)
- Right to explain your side of story
- Right to receive copies of all disciplinary documents
- Right to appeal decision (grievance procedure)
- Right to have witness in meeting (colleague, not lawyer)
- Fair and consistent treatment (same rules for everyone)

**What Makes Discipline Fair:**
- Clear rules and expectations (you know what's expected)
- Consistent application (everyone held to same standards)
- Appropriate to offense (punishment fits the crime)
- Progressive (opportunity to improve except gross misconduct)
- Documented (written record for clarity and legal protection)
- Timely (addressed promptly, not weeks later)

---

## 7.4 WHAT TO DO IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM

**Open Door Policy - We Want to Hear From You:**

**If You Have a Workplace Concern, Issue, or Complaint:**

**STEP 1: Talk to Your Direct Manager First**
- Most issues can be resolved at this level
- Manager knows situation best and can often help immediately
- Private conversation, explain issue clearly
- Give manager chance to address it
- Most problems solved here!

**STEP 2: If Issue Not Resolved OR Issue IS With Your Manager:**
- **Talk to Admin Manager (Mohamed Ali LENDA)**
  * HR issues, policy questions, interpersonal conflicts
  * Can mediate and provide guidance
- **Talk to Operations Manager (Mohamed CHRAITI)** (if you're technical staff)
- **Talk to Sales Manager (Najla BEN SALEM)** (if you're sales staff)
- **Talk to Gérant (Karim BEN SALEM)**
  * For serious issues, ethical concerns
  * When other channels haven't worked

**STEP 3: Skip Your Manager When:**
- Issue involves your manager (conflict, harassment, discrimination)
- Safety concern being ignored
- Ethical violation or illegal activity
- Harassment or serious misconduct
- You don't feel safe raising with manager

Go directly to Admin Manager or Gérant for these serious issues.

- Interviews you, person complained about, witnesses
- Reviews documents and evidence
- Gathers facts objectively and fairly

**Step 4: Decision (Within 14 Days Total)**

  * **Partially upheld:** Some merit, partial remedy provided
  * **Not upheld:** After investigation, no violation found
- Decision communicated to you in writing with explanation

**Step 5: Appeal (If You Disagree)**
