Headquartered in Sfax with a significant branch in Tunis, the company provides nationwide coverage for businesses of all sizes, offering products ranging from fire extinguishers and detection systems to personal protective equipment (PPE) and industrial workwear. The organization is structured as a SARL and is led by Managers Karim Ben Salem and Najla Ben Salem, who oversee strategy, sales, and purchasing.\n\n\n**Core Products and Technical Services**\n\nSS+ offers a wide array of safety solutions designed to meet international and local standards:\nFire Safety Equipment: The company sells, installs, and maintains various fire extinguishers (Powder, CO2, Foam, Water, Clean Agent) from 1kg to over 50kg, providing certificates of installation and compliance documentation.

Emergency services are addressed within 24 hours.\nQuality Assurance: Technicians are highly trained, and all service work is backed by a 06-month warranty. Quality is further managed through a technician self-inspection checklist and random spot-checks by Team Leaders.\nDigital Integration: The company utilizes the WAVE PLUS web application, allowing customers to track service history, certificates, and renewals through an online portal.\n\n\n**Governance and Decision-Making Authority**\n\nThe manual outlines a clear Authority Matrix to ensure efficient and controlled operations:\nStrategic Decisions: Only the Managers can approve major capital investments, legal matters over 10,000 TND, or discounts exceeding 20%.\nFinancial Approval Limits: Spending authority is tiered by position; for example, Operations Responsibles can approve up to 1,000 TND, Team Leaders up to 500 TND, and Technicians up to 100 TND.\nSignature Authority: Contracts and bank transactions over 5,000 TND generally require two signatures from the management team.\n\n\n**Commercial and Financial Policies**\n\nSS+ employs structured pricing and credit policies to manage business risk and customer relations:\nPricing and Discounts: Fire equipment typically has a standard markup of 35%. Sales Representatives have the authority to grant discounts up to 15%, while the Sales Responsible can approve up to 20%.\nPayment Terms: While new customers typically operate on a cash-on-delivery or 50% deposit basis, established and loyal customers may be granted terms of 30, 60, or 90 days.\nTravel Fees: Travel is free within 120 km of the Sfax or Tunis facilities; beyond this, tiered fees apply (e.g., 150 TND for 121–200 km) unless waived for large orders or contract customers.\nRisk Management: The company proactively declines business involving high credit risk, litigious reputations, or technical requirements that exceed their expertise or safety standards.\n\n\n**Ethics and Complaint Handling**\n\nThe company maintains high ethical standards, strictly prohibiting conflicts of interest and the acceptance of expensive gifts over 100 TND. Their complaint handling process is rigorous, requiring acknowledgment within four hours and aiming for investigation and resolution within 24 to 72 hours. If SS+ is at fault for a service error, they provide free rework or correction immediately.
