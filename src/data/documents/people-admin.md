### Overtime Calculation Example

**Employee:** Technician with monthly salary 1,200 TND

**Hourly Rate Calculation:**

- Working hours per month: 48 hours/week × 52 weeks / 12 months = 208 hours/month
- Hourly rate: 1,200 ÷ 208 = 5.77 TND/hour

**Overtime Scenario:** Worked 5 extra hours on weekday + 4 hours on Sunday

**Calculation:**
- Weekday overtime (5 hours): 5 hours × 5.77 × 1.5 = 43.28 TND
- Sunday work (4 hours): 4 hours × 5.77 × 2.0 = 46.16 TND
- **Total overtime pay: 89.44 TND** (added to monthly salary)

## 4.3 COMMISSION STRUCTURE (SALES TEAM)

### Commission Philosophy

**Purpose:**
- Incentivize sales performance
- Reward revenue generation directly
- Attract and retain talented sales people
- Align sales rep interests with company goals

**Design Principles:**
- Simple and transparent (easy to understand)
- Motivating (material impact on earnings)
- Achievable (realistic goals)
- Fair (rewards effort and results)
- Cash flow aligned (pay on collection, not just sales)

---

### SS+ Sales Commission Structure

**Base Salary + Commission Model**

**Base Salary:** 1,000 - 1,500 TND per month (see Section 4.1)
- Provides income stability
- Paid regardless of sales (assuming reasonable effort)

**Commission:** Percentage of sales revenue (collected)
- **CRITICAL:** Commission paid on collected revenue, NOT just invoiced sales
- Reason: Cash flow management, ensures customer actually pays

---

### Commission Rates by Product/Service Category

**Tiered Commission Structure:**

| Product/Service Category | Commission Rate | Notes |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **New Fire Equipment Sales (New Customers/ Projects +40,000 TND)** | 4% | Fire extinguishers, hose reels, alarms, etc. |
| **Fire Equipment Installation Projects** | 3% | Installation contracts, complex projects |
| **Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMC)** | 6% | Of first year annual value (paid over contract life) |
| **PPE & Workwear Sales (New Customers/ Projects +30,000 TND)** | 3% | Products with lower margins |
| **Safety Signage (New Customers/ Projects +20,000 TND)** | 3% | Standard product category |
| **Spare Parts & Consumables (New Customers/ Projects +15,000 TND)** | 2% | Small transactions, lower priority |

---

### Commission Calculation Examples

**Example 1: New Equipment Sale**
- Customer orders 20 fire extinguishers + installation
- Total invoice: 15,000 TND
- Equipment: 12,000 TND × 4% = 480 TND
- Installation: 3,000 TND × 3% = 90 TND
- **Total Commission: 570 TND**
- **When Paid:** When customer pays invoice (if paid in 30 days, commission in Month 2)

**Example 2: Annual Maintenance Contract (3-Year)**
- 3-year AMC contract: Total value 30,000 TND (10,000 TND per year)
- Commission: 10,000 × 6% = 600 TND (on first year value)
- **Payment Schedule:**
  * Year 1: If customer pays annually in advance: 600 TND when payment received
  * OR if customer pays monthly: 600 ÷ 12 = 50 TND per month as payments received
  * Years 2-3: No new commission (already paid on year 1)

**Example 3: Mixed Sale**
- Customer orders: 10 extinguishers (4,000 TND) + PPE supplies (2,000 TND) + Refilling service (500 TND)
- Equipment: 4,000 × 4% = 160 TND
- PPE: 2,000 × 3% = 60 TND
- Service: 500 × 2% = 10 TND
- **Total Commission: 230 TND**

---

### Commission Payment Timing

**CRITICAL RULE: Commission paid when customer pays, not when sale is made**

**Rationale:**
- Cash flow management (company needs cash before paying commission)
- Risk sharing (if customer doesn't pay, rep doesn't get commission)
- Incentivizes good customer credit decisions

**Payment Process:**

**Monthly Commission Calculation** (By 10th of Month)
1. **Admin & Finance Responsible** reviews all customer payments received in previous month
2. Identifies which invoices were paid
3. Links payments to sales rep (from CRM/WAVE PLUS)
4. Calculates commission per category and rate
5. Prepares commission report for each rep

**Commission Statement** (Sent to Sales Rep by 10th)
- Lists all payments received and related commissions
- Shows: Customer name, invoice number, amount paid, category, commission rate, commission earned
- Totals commission for the month

**Commission Payment** (With Monthly Salary - 5th of Month)
- Commission added to salary payment
- Shown separately on payslip: Base Salary + Commission
- Subject to tax and CNSS (included in gross income)

**Example Timeline:**
- January: Sale made and invoiced (Invoice #0125 - 10,000 TND)
- February: Customer pays invoice (payment received Feb 20)
- March: Commission calculated (by March 10)
- March: Commission paid with March salary (March 5 - processed end of Feb, actually paid early March)

---

### Commission Caps and Limits

**No Commission Cap** (Unlimited Earning Potential)
- SS+ does NOT cap commission earnings
- Top performers can earn significantly more
- Encourages aggressive sales effort
- Example: Strong sales rep earning 2,000+ TND commission per month = 3,000+ total income

**Minimum Performance Expectation:**
- Sales reps expected to generate sufficient sales to justify employment
- If consistently earning very low commission (under 300 TND/month for 3+ months) = performance discussion
- May indicate: Lack of effort, poor territory, need for training, or not suitable for role

---

### Commission Clawbacks (Refunds/Returns)

**If Customer Returns Product or Cancels Service:**
- Commission reversed (deducted from future commissions)
- Fair since customer didn't actually pay (or paid and refunded)

**Process:**
1. Customer return/refund processed
2. Admin notes which sale is reversed
3. Commission deducted from sales rep's next commission payment
4. Shown on commission statement as "Adjustment - Return/Refund"

**Dispute Resolution:**
- If sales rep disagrees with commission calculation, can appeal to Sales Responsible
- Sales Responsible reviews and makes final decision
- Transparency: All calculations based on documented payments

---

### Commission for Split Sales (Team Selling)

**When Multiple Reps Involved:**
- Lead generation by one rep, closing by another
- Territory transfer (customer moves, or rep changes territory)
- Team effort (large complex sale)

**Commission Split Rules:**
- **Primary Rep** (who owns customer relationship and closes sale): 70%
- **Supporting Rep** (who generated lead or provided significant support): 30%
- **Agreement Required:** Reps must agree to split (or Sales Responsible decides)
- **Documented:** Split noted in CRM/WAVE PLUS at time of sale

---

### Sales Contests and Bonuses (Periodic)

**In Addition to Regular Commission:**

**Quarterly Sales Contest** (Optional - at Company Discretion)

**STEP 2: Create PIP Document**
- **Contents:**
  * Employee name, position, date
  * Performance issues (specific, detailed)
  * Expected standards (what good performance looks like)
  * Improvement goals (SMART format)
  * Support and resources (training, coaching, tools)
  * Timeline (typically 30-90 days)
  * Consequences if not improved (possible termination)
  * Review schedule (weekly check-ins)

**STEP 3: PIP Meeting (Responsible + Employee)**
- Private meeting
- Present PIP document
- Explain each section clearly
- Allow employee to respond
- Answer questions
- Employee signs (acknowledges receipt and understanding)
- Message: "We want you to succeed. Here's what you need to do."

**STEP 4: Implementation**
- Weekly check-ins (monitor progress)
- Provide coaching and feedback
- Document all interactions
- Adjust support if needed (but not timeline or standards)

**STEP 5: Mid-Point Review** (If 90-day plan, review at 45 days)
- Assess progress
- On track? Behind? Ahead?
- Adjust if needed

**STEP 6: Final Review** (End of PIP Period)
- Comprehensive evaluation
- **Outcomes:**
  1. **Successful:** Performance improved to acceptable level → Remove from PIP, continue normal employment, ongoing monitoring
  2. **Partial Improvement:** Some progress but not sufficient → Extend PIP (30-60 days) with clear goals
  3. **No Improvement:** Failed to improve → Proceed to termination

**STEP 7: Documentation**
- All PIP documents filed in personnel file
- Protects both employee and company
- If termination occurs: Evidence that fair process followed

## 8.3 PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE PROCESS

### Discipline Philosophy

**SS+ Approach to Discipline:**
- **Purpose:** Correct behavior, not punish
- **Progressive:** Start with coaching, escalate if no improvement
- **Fair:** Applied consistently to all employees
- **Documented:** Every step recorded (legal protection)
- **Due Process:** Employee has opportunity to explain and improve

---

### Progressive Discipline Steps

**STEP 1: VERBAL COACHING** (Informal)
- **When:** First minor infraction or performance issue
- **Process:**
  * Responsible speaks with employee privately
  * Explains issue and impact
  * Listens to employee's perspective
  * Clarifies expectations
  * Offers support or resources if needed
  * Sets timeline for improvement (if applicable)
- **Documentation:** Responsible notes discussion in own records (informal)
- **Follow-Up:** Monitor improvement, provide feedback

**If Improvement:** Issue resolved, no further action
**If No Improvement or Repeat:** Escalate to Step 2

---

**STEP 2: VERBAL WARNING** (Formal)
- **When:** Repeat of minor infraction after coaching, OR moderate infraction
- **Process:**
  * Formal meeting (responsible + employee, possibly HR/Admin Responsible present)
  * Responsible states issue clearly
  * Employee given opportunity to respond
  * Expectations for improvement stated clearly
  * Consequences if continues stated
  * Timeline for improvement given (e.g., 30 days)
- **Documentation:** 
  * Verbal Warning Form completed
  * Signed by responsible and employee
  * Placed in personnel file
  * Copy given to employee
- **Follow-Up:** Regular check-ins, document progress or lack thereof

**If Improvement:** Continue monitoring
**If No Improvement or Another Infraction:** Escalate to Step 3

---

**STEP 3: WRITTEN WARNING** (Serious)
- **When:** Repeat after verbal warning, OR serious infraction first time
- **Process:**
  * Formal disciplinary meeting
  * Responsible presents issue and history (prior warnings)
  * Employee responds
  * Written warning letter issued stating:
    - Specific issue/violation
    - Date(s) of occurrence
    - Company policy violated
    - Prior warnings given
    - Expected improvement
    - Consequences if no improvement (possible termination)
    - Timeline (e.g., 60 days)
  * Employee signs (acknowledgment of receipt, not agreement)
- **Documentation:**
  * Written warning letter (original in file, copy to employee)
  * Meeting notes
- **Follow-Up:** Close monitoring

**If Improvement:** Remain on written warning (probation period)
**If No Improvement or Another Serious Infraction:** Escalate to Step 4

---

**STEP 4: FINAL WRITTEN WARNING / SUSPENSION**
- **When:** Repeat after written warning, OR very serious infraction
- **Process:**
  * May include unpaid suspension (1-5 days) to emphasize seriousness
  * Final written warning issued:
    - Details all prior discipline
    - States this is final warning
    - Any further infraction will result in termination
    - Clear performance/behavior expectations
    - Timeline (e.g., 90 days "last chance")
  * Employee signs
- **Documentation:** Final warning letter, suspension letter (if applicable)
- **Follow-Up:** Very close monitoring

**If Improvement:** Employee may eventually move off probationary status (after extended period of good behavior)
**If No Improvement or Any Further Infraction:** Termination

---

**STEP 5: TERMINATION**
- **When:** After final warning with no improvement, OR gross misconduct
- **Process:** See Section 8.5 below

---

### Discipline Process Guidelines

**Responsible Responsibilities:**
- **Be Timely:** Address issues promptly (not weeks later)
- **Be Specific:** Cite exact behaviors/incidents with dates
- **Be Objective:** Focus on facts, not opinions or feelings
- **Be Consistent:** Apply same standards to all employees
- **Be Fair:** Listen to employee's side, consider circumstances
- **Be Private:** Discipline meetings in private (never public humiliation)
- **Be Documented:** Write everything down

**Employee Rights:**
- Right to know what policy/standard was violated
- Right to explain and respond
- Right to receive copy of disciplinary documents
- Right to appeal (see grievance procedure Section 10.3)
- Right to have witness present in meeting (colleague, not lawyer)

---

## 8.4 SERIOUS MISCONDUCT

### Immediate Suspension (Pending Investigation)

**When Serious Allegation Made:**
1. **Immediate Action:** Remove employee from workplace (safety/security)
2. **Suspension:** Paid suspension initially (until investigation complete)
3. **Investigation:** Conducted promptly (within days, not weeks)
   - Interview complainant, witnesses, accused employee
   - Gather evidence (documents, CCTV, etc.)
   - Objective fact-finding
4. **Decision:**
   - **Confirmed:** Termination (gross misconduct)
   - **Not Confirmed:** Reinstate employee, remove suspension from record
   - **Partially Confirmed:** Appropriate discipline (may be less than termination)

**Examples:**
- Theft allegation → Suspend, investigate, if confirmed terminate
- Harassment complaint → Suspend alleged harasser, investigate thoroughly
- Violence/fight → Suspend both parties, investigate, appropriate action

---

### Gross Misconduct Termination

**No Notice Period Required (Per Tunisian Labor Code):**
- Gross misconduct allows immediate termination without notice period
- But still must follow fair process (investigation, hearing)

**Process:**
1. Suspension (paid pending investigation)
2. Investigation (thorough, documented)
3. Disciplinary hearing:
   - Employee informed of allegations
   - Evidence presented
   - Employee given opportunity to respond
   - Decision made
4. If terminated:
   - Termination letter (states gross misconduct, effective immediately)
   - No severance pay (gross misconduct forfeits severance)
   - Final pay: Salary to last day + unused leave
   - Return company property

**Legal Protection:**
- Thorough documentation protects company if employee claims unfair dismissal
- Employee can appeal to labor tribunal if believes termination unjust
- Company must prove gross misconduct occurred
- Fair process is critical defense

**5. CNSS End-of-Service Benefits**
