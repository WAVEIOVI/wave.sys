**Product Sales:**
- When products delivered and customer takes possession
- For ex-works sales: When customer picks up

**Deposit/Advance Payments:**
- Recorded as "Customer Deposits" (liability)
- Not recognized as revenue until service/delivery completed
- Converted to revenue when final invoice issued

## 2.4 CREDIT NOTES & ADJUSTMENTS

### When Credit Notes Are Issued

**Valid Reasons for Credit Note:**
1. **Service Quality Issue:**
   - Service not performed to standard
   - Customer legitimate complaint
   - Rework required but customer accepts credit instead

2. **Pricing Error:**
   - Invoice amount incorrect (overcharged)
   - Wrong price applied (not per quotation)
   - Discount authorized but not applied

3. **Product Return:**
   - Defective product returned
   - Wrong product delivered
   - Unused product returned per return policy

4. **Cancelled Service:**
   - Service invoiced but not performed
   - Customer cancelled after invoicing

5. **Overbilling:**
   - Quantity error
   - Duplicate invoice
   - Services/products invoiced but not delivered

**NOT Valid Reasons:**
- Customer just asks for discount after the fact (without cause)
- Customer payment difficulty (negotiate payment plan instead)
- Customer relationship management (should be discount at time of sale)

### Credit Note Authorization

**Authority Levels:**

| Credit Amount | Required Approval | Documentation Required |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Up to 500 TND | Operations Responsable or Sales Responsable | Service report or return documentation |
| 501 - 1,000 TND | Sales Responsable | As above + written explanation |
| 1,001 - 5,000 TND | Sales Responsable + Manager review | As above + customer letter/complaint |
| Above 5,000 TND | Both Managers | Full documentation + investigation report |

### Credit Note Process

**Step 1: Credit Request**
- Customer submits complaint or return
- Sales rep or technician documents issue
- Supporting evidence gathered (photos, service report, etc.)
- Request submitted to appropriate responsable per authority matrix

**Step 2: Approval**
- Manager reviews documentation
- Verifies facts (may require site visit or customer discussion)
- Determines appropriate credit amount (partial or full)
- Documents approval in writing (email or approval form)

**Step 3: Issue Credit Note**
- Admin & Finance Responsable creates credit note in Softcom
- Credit note must reference:
  * Original invoice number and date
  * Reason for credit (specific)
  * Approval authority
- Credit note number generated (CN-YEAR-SEQUENCE)

**Step 4: Customer Communication**
- Email credit note PDF to customer
- Explain how credit will be applied:
  * Applied to outstanding balance (if any)
  * Applied to next invoice
  * Refund issued (requires Manager approval - rare)
- Confirm customer understanding and acceptance

**Step 5: Accounting Treatment**
- Record credit note in Softcom
- Reduces revenue in current period
- Reduces accounts receivable for customer
- Updates customer account balance
- If refund: Process per refund procedure

### Credit Note Format

**Credit Note Must Include:**
- All standard invoice information (legal requirements)
- "CREDIT NOTE" clearly marked
- Credit note number (CN-2025-XXXX)
- Original invoice number and date being credited
- Clear reason for credit
- Amount credited (should match or be less than original)

- Authorized by (name and signature if printed)

### Debit Notes (Rare)

**When Issued:**
- Undercharged customer (invoice too low)
- Additional services provided after original invoice
- Correction to customer's benefit that requires adjustment

**Process:**
- Generally prefer to issue new invoice for additional charges
- Debit note used only if specifically adjusting previous invoice
- Same approval process as credit notes
- Customer communication must be very clear (avoiding confusion)

### Monthly Credit Note Report

**Prepared By:** Admin & Finance Responsable  
**Frequency:** Monthly  
**Reviewed By:** Sales Responsable and Managers

**Report Includes:**
- All credit notes issued in month
- Total credit amount and impact on revenue
- Credit notes by reason/category

**Step 6: Prepare Reconciliation**

**Bank Reconciliation Format:**
```
SS+ Bank Reconciliation - [Bank Name] - [Month Year]

Balance per Bank Statement (ending [date])          [Amount] TND

Add: Deposits in Transit
     [Date] - [Description]                         [Amount]
     [Date] - [Description]                         [Amount]
     Total Deposits in Transit:                     [Amount] TND

Less: Outstanding Checks
     [Check#] - [Date] - [Payee]                   ([Amount])
     [Check#] - [Date] - [Payee]                   ([Amount])
     Total Outstanding Checks:                     ([Amount]) TND

Adjusted Bank Balance:                              [Amount] TND

Balance per Books (Softcom)                         [Amount] TND

Add/Less: Bank Items Not Yet Recorded
     Bank charges                                   ([Amount])
     Bank interest                                   [Amount]
     [Other items]                                   [Amount]

Adjusted Book Balance:                              [Amount] TND

DIFFERENCE (should be ZERO):                        [Amount] TND

If difference is not zero, explain:
_____________________________________________________________

Prepared by: _________________ Date: _______
Reviewed by: _________________ Date: _______
```

**Step 7: Investigate Differences**
- Any difference must be investigated and explained
- Common causes:
  * Timing differences (resolved next period)
  * Recording errors in books
  * Bank errors (contact bank)
  * Unauthorized transactions (serious - escalate immediately)
  * Duplicate entries
  * Math errors

**Step 8: Record Adjustments**
- Enter all bank charges/fees in Softcom
- Record bank interest earned
- Record any items found on statement not in books
- Correct any errors discovered
- Post all adjustments before finalizing reconciliation

**Step 9: Management Review**
- Admin & Finance Responsable signs completed reconciliation
- File reconciliation with supporting documents
- Report any unusual items or concerns to Manager
- Large or unusual transactions explained in writing

### Reconciliation Red Flags

**Immediate Escalation to Manager If:**
- Reconciliation difference over 500 TND unexplained
- Unauthorized withdrawal or check
- Missing deposits
- Duplicate payments
- Checks cleared that were never issued
- Evidence of potential fraud or error

### Outstanding Items Follow-Up

**Outstanding Checks:**
- Review list monthly
- Checks over 60 days: Contact payee to verify received
- Checks over 90 days: Consider voiding and reissuing
- Very old checks (6+ months): May need to write back into books (per accounting rules)

**Deposits in Transit:**
- Should clear within 1-3 business days
- If not cleared within 5 days: Contact bank to investigate
- If lost: Provide copy of deposit slip to bank for tracing

### Dual Control Procedures

**Segregation of Duties:**
- Person preparing reconciliation should NOT:
  * Be sole check signer
  * Handle customer payments without oversight
  * Process all bank deposits alone
  * Have sole access to online banking

**Best Practice:**
- Reconciliation prepared by Admin & Finance Responsable
- Sample review by Manager or external bookkeeper
- Surprise reconciliations (quarterly) by independent person
- Bank statements sent to Manager's email (not just finance staff)

3. **Propose Solution:** 
   - Partial payment now, balance in X days
   - Extended payment date (get agreement in writing)
   - Payment plan if very large amount
4. **Maintain Relationship:** Don't ignore supplier calls/emails
5. **Honor Commitment:** Pay when promised

**Supplier Late Payment Fees:**

# Section 5: PRICING & MARGINS

## 5.1 COST STRUCTURE & MARKUP STRATEGY

### Understanding Our Costs

**Product Costs (Fire Equipment, PPE, Workwear, Signage):**

**Direct Product Costs:**
- Purchase price from supplier (cost of goods)
- Import duties/taxes (if imported)
- Freight/shipping to our facility
- Customs clearance fees

**Formula:**
```
Landed Cost = Purchase Price + Duties + Freight + Clearance
```

**Service Costs (Inspection, Maintenance, Installation):**

**Direct Service Costs:**
- Technician labor (hourly rate or daily rate)
- Refilling materials (powder, CO2, foam, etc.)
- Replacement parts (seals, valves, gauges, hoses)
- Consumables (tags, stickers, service documentation)
- Vehicle fuel for travel
- Equipment/tools (depreciation allocated)

**Indirect Costs (Overhead):**
- Facility rent (workshop, warehouse, office)
- Utilities (electricity, water, internet, phone)
- Vehicle maintenance and insurance
- Management and admin salaries
- Insurance (liability, workers comp)
- Marketing and business development
- IT systems (Softcom, WAVE PLUS)
- Professional fees (legal, accounting)
- Training and certification

**Overhead Allocation:**
- Total overhead costs per month: [Amount TND]
- Divided by: Productive hours or revenue (allocation method)
- Overhead rate: [X]% of direct costs or [Amount TND] per hour

### Markup Strategy by Product/Service Type

**Standard Markup Percentages:**

| Product/Service Category | Target Markup | Minimum Acceptable | Notes |
|--------------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Fire Extinguishers (Product)** | 35-45% | 25% | Higher for specialty types |
| **Fire Hose Reels** | 40-50% | 30% | Includes installation markup |
| **PPE - Standard Items** | 30-40% | 20% | Competitive market |
| **PPE - Specialty Items** | 45-60% | 35% | Less competition |
| **Workwear - Standard** | 30-40% | 25% | Volume sensitive |
| **Workwear - Custom/Branded** | 50-70% | 40% | Value-added service |
| **Safety Signage - Standard** | 40-50% | 30% | Production cost plus |
| **Safety Signage - Custom** | 60-80% | 50% | Design + production |
| **Inspection Services** | 50-60% | 40% | Labor + overhead |
| **Maintenance/Refilling** | 40-50% | 30% | Materials + labor |
| **Installation Services** | 50-65% | 40% | Skilled labor premium |
| **AMC (Annual Contracts)** | 35-45% | 25% | Discounted for commitment |

**Markup Calculation:**
```
Selling Price = Cost × (1 + Markup %)

Example:
Fire extinguisher cost: 100 TND
Markup: 40%
Selling Price = 100 × (1.40) = 140 TND
```

**Or Using Margin:**
```
Selling Price = Cost ÷ (1 - Margin %)

If target margin is 30%:
Selling Price = 100 ÷ (1 - 0.30) = 100 ÷ 0.70 = 142.86 TND

Note: 
Markup 40% ≈ Margin 28.6%
Markup 50% = Margin 33.3%
Markup 100% = Margin 50%
```

### Pricing Considerations

**Factors That Increase Pricing:**
- Specialized/technical products
- Rush delivery/emergency service
- Remote locations (travel time)
- After-hours service
- Warranty/guarantee provisions
- Technical complexity
- Certification requirements
- Custom specifications

**Factors That May Decrease Pricing:**
- Large volume orders
- Long-term contracts (predictable revenue)
- Off-peak scheduling flexibility
- Repeat customers (relationship value)
- Competitive pressure
- Market conditions
- Strategic customer (reference value)

**Competitive Pricing Analysis:**
- Monitor competitor pricing (quarterly)
- Understand our positioning (premium, mid-market, or value)
- Price competitively where differentiation is low
- Price for value where we have advantages (quality, service, expertise)

### Pricing Psychology

**Price Points:**
- Use psychological pricing: 995 TND instead of 1,000 TND
- Bundle pricing: Package multiple services for perceived value
- Tiered pricing: Good-Better-Best options

**Volume Discounts (Standard Schedule):**

| Quantity Range | Discount from List Price |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| 1-9 units | 0% (list price) |
| 10-49 units | 5-8% |
| 50-99 units | 10-12% |
| 100-499 units | 15-18% |
| 500+ units | 20%+ (quote basis) |

*Note: Specific discount percentage within range depends on product category and margins*

## 5.3 DISCOUNT IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Understanding Discount Impact on Profitability

**Critical Concept:** Discounts have magnified impact on profit

**Example Analysis:**

**Scenario: Fire Extinguisher Sale**
- Cost: 100 TND
- Standard Price: 140 TND (40% markup, 28.6% margin)
- Profit: 40 TND

**Discount Impact:**

| Discount % | Selling Price | Profit | Profit Reduction | Sales Increase Needed to Maintain Profit |
|------------|---------------|--------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 0% | 140 TND | 40 TND | 0% | 0% |
| 5% | 133 TND | 33 TND | -17.5% | +21% |
| 10% | 126 TND | 26 TND | -35% | +54% |
| 12.5% | 122.5 TND | 22.5 TND | -43.8% | +78% |
| 15% | 119 TND | 19 TND | -52.5% | +111% |
| 20% | 112 TND | 12 TND | -70% | +233% |
| 25% | 105 TND | 5 TND | -87.5% | +700% |

**Key Insight:** A 12.5% discount reduces profit by 43.8% and requires 78% more sales volume to maintain same total profit!

### Discount Authorization with Profit Awareness

**Sales Representatives (up to 12.5% discount):**
- Understand: This discount reduces profit significantly
- Use for: Large volumes, strategic customers, competitive wins
- Don't use for: Just to close easy sale or avoid negotiation

**Sales Responsable (up to 20% discount):**
- Requires strong justification
- Typically needs: Very large order, multi-year contract, strategic account
- Analyzes: Lifetime customer value, not just single transaction

**Manager (above 20% discount):**
- Exceptional circumstances only
- Examples: Major contract win, market entry, capacity utilization
- Full analysis required

### Discount Alternatives

**Instead of Price Discount, Consider:**

1. **Value-Added Services:**
   - Free delivery/installation
   - Extended warranty
   - Priority service scheduling
   - Free training session
   - Bundled inspection services

2. **Payment Terms:**
   - Extended terms (Net 60 instead of Net 30)
   - No deposit required
   - Early payment discount (2% if paid in 10 days)

3. **Volume Incentives:**
   - Tiered pricing (price breaks at quantity levels)
   - Loyalty program (discount on next order)
   - Rebates (annual rebate based on total purchases)

4. **Contract Terms:**
   - Annual maintenance contract (predictable revenue)
   - Exclusive supplier agreement
   - Multi-year commitment with annual discounts

**When to Walk Away:**
- Customer demands discount below minimum acceptable margin
- Customer is just shopping price (no loyalty potential)
- Volume insufficient to justify discount
- Customer payment risk high
- Better opportunities available

### Key Aging Metrics

**Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):**
```
DSO = (Accounts Receivable / Revenue) × Number of Days

Example:
AR Balance: 50,000 TND
Monthly Revenue: 100,000 TND
DSO = (50,000 / 100,000) × 30 days = 15 days

Target DSO: Under 45 days
Acceptable: 45-60 days
Concerning: Over 60 days
```

**Collection Effectiveness Index (CEI):**
```
CEI = (Beginning AR + Credit Sales - Ending AR) / (Beginning AR + Credit Sales - Current AR) × 100%

Target CEI: Over 85%
Good: 80-85%
Needs Improvement: Under 80%
```

**Percentage Overdue:**
```
% Overdue = (Overdue AR / Total AR) × 100%

Target: Under 25%
Acceptable: 25-35%
Concerning: Over 35%
```

## 6.4 BAD DEBT MANAGEMENT

### Identifying Potential Bad Debts

**Warning Signs:**
- Over 90 days overdue with no payment or contact
- Customer not responding to calls/emails
- Business appears closed or relocated
- Dishonored checks or traites
- Customer declares bankruptcy
- Legal disputes with customer
- Other creditors also pursuing customer

**Proactive Identification:**
- Monthly review of 60+ days aging
- Quarterly bad debt reserve analysis
- Industry news monitoring for customer difficulties

### Bad Debt Reserve (Allowance for Doubtful Accounts)

**Accounting Treatment:**
- Establish reserve based on aging and history
- Reserve reduces reported AR and profit
- Acts as buffer for eventual write-offs

**Reserve Calculation Method:**

| Aging Category | Reserve % |
|----------------|-----------|
| Current | 1% |
| 1-30 days | 5% |
| 31-60 days | 15% |
| 61-90 days | 40% |
| 90-180 days | 75% |
| Over 180 days | 100% |

**Example:**
```
Aging Category | AR Amount | Reserve % | Reserve Amount
_______________|___________|___________|_______________
Current        | 50,000    | 1%        | 500
1-30 days      | 20,000    | 5%        | 1,000
31-60 days     | 8,000     | 15%       | 1,200
61-90 days     | 3,000     | 40%       | 1,200
90-180 days    | 2,000     | 75%       | 1,500
Over 180 days  | 1,000     | 100%      | 1,000
_______________|___________|___________|_______________
TOTAL          | 84,000    |           | 6,400 TND
```

Reserve of 6,400 TND represents expected bad debt.

### Write-Off Process

**When to Write Off:**
- All collection efforts exhausted
- Legal action uneconomical or unsuccessful
- Customer bankrupt or untraceable
- Amount uncollectible beyond reasonable doubt
- Usually: Over 180 days with no recovery prospect

**Write-Off Authorization:**

| Amount | Required Approval |
|--------|------------------|
| Up to 2,000 TND | Both Managers |
| Over 2,000 TND | Both Managers + documentation + legal opinion |

**Write-Off Documentation Required:**
- Complete collection history (all contacts, letters, calls)
- Customer financial status (bankrupt, closed, etc.)
- Legal advice (if applicable)
- Cost-benefit analysis of further action
- Recommendation memo
- Approval signatures

**Accounting Entry:**
```
Debit: Bad Debt Expense (or Allowance for Doubtful Accounts)
Credit: Accounts Receivable (specific customer)

Effect: Removes AR from books, recognizes loss
```

**Post Write-Off Actions:**
- Customer file marked "Bad Debt - No Credit Ever"
- Block in Softcom system (cannot create orders)
- Continue legal pursuit if amount significant (write-off is accounting, not forgiveness)
- If customer later pays: Record as "Bad Debt Recovery" (income)

### Legal Action Decision

**When to Pursue Legally:**
- Amount over 2,000 TND (typically)
- Customer has assets to recover
- Clear debt with documentation
- Customer unresponsive to normal collection

**Legal Action Process:**
1. **Consultation:** Meet with attorney
2. **Cost Analysis:** Legal fees vs. recovery probability
3. **Approval:** Both Managers approve
4. **Demand Letter:** Attorney sends formal demand
5. **Filing:** Lawsuit filed if no response
6. **Judgment:** Court judgment obtained
7. **Enforcement:** Seizure, garnishment, etc.
8. **Collection:** Payment recovered (minus legal costs)

**Cost Considerations:**
- Attorney fees: [Amount range]
- Court fees: [Amount]
- Time investment: Significant
- Recovery rate: Typically 30-70% of debt
- Timeline: 6-18 months or more

**Alternatives to Litigation:**
- Mediation or arbitration
- Payment plan under legal agreement
- Partial settlement (take less, close case)
- Collection agency (they take percentage, typically 25-40%)

### Prevention Better Than Cure

**Best Practices to Minimize Bad Debt:**
1. **Strong Credit Evaluation:** Don't extend credit to high-risk customers
2. **Clear Terms:** Payment terms understood and agreed upfront
3. **Prompt Invoicing:** Invoice immediately upon service/delivery
4. **Proactive Collection:** Start follow-up before overdue
5. **Relationship Management:** Good communication reduces problems
6. **Early Escalation:** Don't let problems age
7. **Credit Limit Discipline:** Enforce limits strictly
8. **Diversification:** Don't over-concentrate AR in few customers
9. **Deposits for Risk:** Require deposits for new/risky customers
10. **Regular Reviews:** Monthly AR review, adjust credit as needed

### Cash Flow Forecast Assumptions

**Inflows (Customer Payments):**
- Based on current AR aging
- Expected collection percentages:
  * Current: 90% paid within terms
  * 1-30 days: 50% collected per week
  * 31-60 days: 25% collected per week
  * 61+ days: 10% collected per week
- New sales forecast (conservative estimate)
- Large expected payments noted specifically

**Outflows (Payments):**
- Supplier payments: Per payment terms and scheduled payment runs
- Payroll: Fixed date each month
- Rent: Monthly fixed dates
- Taxes: Per tax calendar
- Loan payments: Per loan schedule
- Other: Historical average or known commitments

### Cash Flow Actions

**If Surplus Cash Projected:**
- Negotiate early payment discounts with suppliers
- Pay down debt (if economical)
- Build emergency reserve
- Consider investments (equipment, marketing, etc.)
- Owner distributions (if appropriate)

**If Cash Shortage Projected:**
- Accelerate collections (contact customers, offer discounts)
- Delay non-critical payments (negotiate with suppliers)
- Reduce discretionary spending
- Consider short-term financing (overdraft, short-term loan)
- Defer owner drawings
- Adjust payment terms with suppliers
- Increase deposit requirements from customers

**Minimum Cash Balance Target:** 20,000 TND  
**Comfortable Cash Balance:** 40,000+ TND  
**Alert Level:** Below 25,000 TND - Managers notified immediately

## 9.3 CAPITAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS

### Capital Expenditure (CapEx) Definition

**Capital Expenditures:** Purchases of long-term assets (vehicles, equipment, facilities, IT systems)

**Characteristics:**
- Cost over 2,000 TND typically
- Useful life over 1 year
- Creates or improves asset
- Capitalized (depreciated over time vs. expensed immediately)

### CapEx Approval Process

**Proposal Requirements:**
1. **Business Case:**
   - What: Description of asset/project
   - Why: Business justification (revenue growth, cost saving, replacement, compliance)
   - Cost: Purchase price + installation + training
   - Timing: When needed, when funds required

2. **Financial Analysis:**
   - Total investment required
   - Expected benefits (revenue increase, cost savings)
   - Payback period (how long to recover investment)
   - Return on Investment (ROI) percentage
   - Impact on cash flow

3. **Alternatives Considered:**
   - Other options evaluated
   - Why this option chosen
   - Lease vs. buy analysis (if applicable)

**Approval Authority:**

| Investment Amount | Required Approval | Documentation |
|------------------|------------------|---------------|
| 2,000 - 10,000 TND | Operations Responsable + Sales Responsable | Business case email |
| 10,001 - 30,000 TND | Above + Manager approval | Formal proposal document |
| Over 30,000 TND | Both Managers | Comprehensive analysis + presentation |

### CapEx Evaluation Criteria

**Payback Period:**
```
Payback Period = Investment Cost / Annual Benefit

Example:
New vehicle cost: 30,000 TND
Annual fuel savings vs. old vehicle: 3,000 TND
Payback = 30,000 / 3,000 = 10 years (too long - may not justify)

But if revenue generation capability: 15,000 TND/year additional
Payback = 30,000 / 15,000 = 2 years (reasonable)
```

**Return on Investment (ROI):**
```
ROI = (Annual Benefit / Investment Cost) × 100%

Example:
Investment: 20,000 TND
Annual benefit: 6,000 TND
ROI = (6,000 / 20,000) × 100% = 30% ROI

Target ROI: Minimum 20% for discretionary investments
```

**Strategic Value:**
- Competitive advantage gained
- Customer satisfaction improvement
- Employee productivity/satisfaction
- Future opportunity creation
- Risk reduction

### CapEx Budget Management

**Annual CapEx Budget:**
- Total planned: [Amount TND]
- By category:
  * Vehicles: [Amount]
  * Equipment: [Amount]
  * IT: [Amount]
  * Facilities: [Amount]

**Mid-Year Review:**
- Assess spending vs. budget
- Evaluate whether planned investments still needed
- Consider new priority investments
- Adjust if business conditions changed

**Unbudgeted CapEx:**
- Emergency replacements (vehicle breakdown, equipment failure)
- Unexpected opportunities (great deal, customer requirement)
- Requires Manager approval even if under normal authority limit
