2. ✅ Understand customer need and urgency
3. ✅ Qualify the opportunity (real need, budget, timeline)

5. ✅ Begin relationship building

### Customer Qualification (BANT Framework)

Before investing significant time, qualify the lead using **BANT**:

#### **B - BUDGET**
*Questions to ask:*

- "Is budget already approved, or does this need approval?"
- "Are you looking for a quote to include in a budget proposal?"

*What we're assessing:*
- Do they have financial capacity?
- Is this a real project or just exploring?
- What's the realistic deal size?

#### **A - AUTHORITY**
*Questions to ask:*
- "Who else is involved in this decision?"
- "What's your role in the selection process?"
- "Who has final approval authority?"

*What we're assessing:*
- Are we talking to decision maker?
- Who else do we need to reach?
- What's the decision-making process?

#### **N - NEED**
*Questions to ask:*
- "What's driving this need right now?"
- "What problem are you trying to solve?"
- "What happens if you don't address this?"
- "What are you currently using/doing?"

*What we're assessing:*
- Is there a real, urgent need?
- What's the pain point?
- How important is solving this?

#### **T - TIMELINE**
*Questions to ask:*

- "What's driving your timeline?"
- "When are you making a decision?"

*What we're assessing:*
- How urgent is this?
- What's realistic timeline?
- When should we follow up?

### Qualification Outcome

After initial conversation, categorize:

**✅ QUALIFIED** - Has Budget, Authority/Access, Real Need, Clear Timeline 

→ **Action:** Proceed to site survey or quotation preparation

**⚠️ PARTIALLY QUALIFIED** - Missing 1-2 BANT elements but promising

→ **Action:** Continue conversation, gather missing information, nurture

**❌ NOT QUALIFIED** - No budget, no authority, no real need, or no timeline

**Gather Information:**
- Customer inquiry details
- Site survey findings and photos
- WAVE PLUS customer profile
- Previous quotations (if repeat customer)
- Special requirements or constraints

**Clarify Uncertainties:**
- If anything is unclear, call customer before quoting
- Don't guess or assume
- Better to ask than quote incorrectly

**Use Appropriate Pricing Method:**

**For Fire Equipment Services:**
- Reference master price list for standard services
- Calculate based on quantity and type
- Add travel fees if beyond 120km
- Consider volume discounts if applicable

**For Fire Equipment Products:**
- Cost + standard markup
- Check current supplier prices if needed
- Volume discounts for larger quantities
- Include installation if part of scope

**For PPE & Workwear:**
- Reference supplier catalogs and current pricing
- Apply standard markup
- Calculate custom printing costs (if applicable)
- Quantity tier pricing

**For MSA:**
- Calculate based on equipment count and visit frequency
- Apply discount vs. individual service pricing (typically 10-20% discount)
- Include all services in scope clearly

**Discount Considerations:**
- Stay within your authority (up to 15% for sales reps)
- Justify any discount in quotation notes
- Get approval for discounts over 15% before sending

## 1.5 FOLLOW-UP & CLOSING THE SALE

### Follow-Up Strategy

**The fortune is in the follow-up.** Most sales are won or lost in how well we follow up after sending the quotation.

### Follow-Up Timeline

**Day 0: Quotation Sent**
- Confirm customer received quotation (phone call or email)
- Ask if they need clarification on anything
- Set expectation: "I'll check back with you in 2-3 days"

**Day 2-3: First Follow-Up Call** 📞

*Purpose:* Ensure they reviewed it, answer questions, gauge interest

*Script:*
"Good morning [Name], this is [Your Name] from SS+. I'm following up on the quotation I sent you on [date] for [project]. Have you had a chance to review it?"

**If YES, they reviewed:**
- "Great! Do you have any questions about our proposal?"
- "How does this compare to what you were expecting?"
- "What are your thoughts on moving forward?"
- **Listen carefully** to concerns or objections
- Address concerns (see Objection Handling section)
- "What's your timeline for making a decision?"
- "What are the next steps on your end?"

**If NO, haven't reviewed yet:**
- "No problem. When do you think you'll have time to look at it?"
- "Is there anything preventing you from reviewing it? Can I help?"
- "Would it be helpful if I walked you through it over the phone?"
- Agree on specific next follow-up date

**Day 7: Second Follow-Up** 📧 or 📞

*If no response to first follow-up:*

Email template:
*Subject: Following up - Quotation [Number]*

*Hi [Name],*

*I wanted to follow up on the quotation I sent last week for [project]. I haven't heard back from you and wanted to make sure it arrived and that you don't have any questions.*

*Are you still interested in moving forward? If you need any clarification or adjustments, I'm happy to discuss.*

*Could you let me know your timeline so I can best support you?*

*Thanks,*
*[Your Name]*

**Day 10-14: Third Follow-Up** 📞

*Phone call - More direct approach:*

"Hi [Name], I've reached out a couple of times about the quotation for [project]. I want to respect your time, so I'm wondering:
- Are you still interested in this project?
- Is there something holding up the decision?
- Is there anything I can do to help move this forward?
- Should I check back at a different time?"

**Listen for:**
- Genuine delays (budget approval, other priorities) → Schedule specific follow-up
- Price concerns → Discuss value, options, negotiate if appropriate
- Chose competitor → Politely ask why, learn for future, thank them
- Not interested → Thank them, ask to stay in touch for future needs

**Day 21: Fourth Follow-Up** 📧

*Last attempt before moving to "cold" status:*

*Subject: Final follow-up - Quotation [Number]*

*Hi [Name],*

*I've reached out several times regarding our quotation for [project], but haven't been able to connect with you.*

*I understand you may be busy or have decided to go in a different direction. If this project is still on your radar, I'm here to help.*

*If I don't hear from you, I'll assume this isn't a priority right now and won't follow up further. However, please feel free to reach out anytime in the future - we'd be happy to work with you.*

*Best regards,*
*[Your Name]*

**After Day 21:**
- Move to "Cold" status in WAVE PLUS
- Monthly gentle check-in (brief email or call every 30 days)
- Don't be pushy - stay friendly and available
- Re-activate if customer responds

### Follow-Up Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Be persistent but not annoying (4-5 touches over 3 weeks is reasonable)
- ✅ Vary your approach (call, email, mix)
- ✅ Add value in each contact (new info, answer questions, insights)
- ✅ Be friendly and professional, never desperate or pushy
- ✅ Document every interaction in WAVE PLUS
- ✅ Set specific next actions (don't just say "follow up later")
- ✅ Ask direct questions ("Are you still interested?")
- ✅ Listen more than you talk

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Give up after one follow-up
- ❌ Be passive ("Just checking in...")
- ❌ Pressure or guilt trip the customer
- ❌ Bad mouth competitors
- ❌ Fake urgency ("This price expires tomorrow!")
- ❌ Forget to document follow-ups
- ❌ Take non-responses personally

### Closing Techniques

When customer is ready to move forward:

**Ask for the Business:**
- "Would you like to proceed with this?"
- "Can I prepare the contract/work order for you?"
- "When would you like us to start?"

**Assumptive Close** (when signals are positive):
- "I'll go ahead and schedule you for [date]. Does that work?"
- "Let me prepare the paperwork. Do you prefer email or printed copy?"

**Choice Close:**
- "Would you prefer the 3-year or 5-year contract?"
- "Should we start with installation next week or the week after?"

**Trial Close** (test readiness):
- "If we could start next week, would that work for you?"
- "If the price was acceptable, would you be ready to move forward?"

**Direct Close:**
- "What do we need to do to earn your business?"
- "What's preventing you from saying yes today?"

**When Customer Says Yes:**
1. ✅ Confirm verbally
2. ✅ Summarize what was agreed
3. ✅ Explain next steps clearly
4. ✅ Set timeline expectations
5. ✅ Send confirmation email immediately
6. ✅ Prepare contract or work order
7. ✅ Coordinate with Operations Responsible for scheduling
8. ✅ Thank customer for their business
9. ✅ Update WAVE PLUS (status: Won)
10. ✅ Celebrate! 🎉

## 1.6 OVERCOMING COMMON OBJECTIONS

### Understanding Objections

Objections are normal and healthy parts of the sales process. They indicate customer is engaged and thinking seriously about the decision.

**Types of Objections:**
- **Price** - "Too expensive"
- **Value** - "Don't see the need" or "Don't see the value"
- **Timing** - "Not right now"
- **Competition** - "Your competitor is cheaper"
- **Trust** - "Don't know your company"
- **Authority** - "Need to check with others"

### The Objection Handling Framework

**Step 1: LISTEN**
- Let customer fully express concern
- Don't interrupt
- Show empathy

**Step 2: ACKNOWLEDGE**
- Validate their concern
- Show understanding
- "I understand your concern about..."

**Step 3: CLARIFY**
- Ask questions to understand the real issue
- "Can you tell me more about...?"
- Often the stated objection isn't the real one

**Step 4: RESPOND**
- Address the specific concern
- Use facts, examples, testimonials
- Reframe perspective

**Step 5: CONFIRM**
- "Does that address your concern?"
- "What else is important to you?"

**Step 6: MOVE FORWARD**
- Return to closing conversation
- "So if we can resolve [concern], are you ready to move forward?"

### Common Objection #1: "Your Price is Too High"

**What They Really Mean:**
- I don't see the value
- I got a cheaper quote elsewhere
- I need to negotiate
- I don't have the budget
- I'm not the decision maker (need ammunition for my boss)

**How to Respond:**

**Technique 1: Value Justification**

*"I understand price is important. Let me explain what makes our pricing different...*

*At SS+, our pricing reflects:*
- *23 years of proven expertise and reliability*
- *Certified technicians - not just anyone can work on life-safety equipment*
- *100% certified products and genuine spare parts - we comply with Tunisian and international standards*
- *06-month warranty on all service work*
- *Quick response times - including 24-hour emergency service*
- *Proper documentation and compliance certificates*
- *Two locations (Sfax and Tunis) for better coverage*

*When it comes to fire safety, you're not just buying a service - you're buying protection for your people and assets. The cheapest option could cost you much more if equipment fails when you need it most.*

*What's most important to you: lowest price or best value and reliability?"*

**Technique 2: Cost of Failure**

*"I appreciate budget concerns. But let me ask you: what's the cost if:*
- *A fire extinguisher doesn't work in an emergency?*
- *Your insurance claim is denied because equipment wasn't properly certified?*
- *An employee is injured due to faulty or non-compliant safety equipment?*
- *You fail a safety inspection and face fines or operational shutdown?*

*The difference between our price and the cheapest option is usually [X TND]. Is that difference worth the risk?"*

**Technique 3: Break Down the Price**

*"Let's look at the actual cost. For your Annual Maintenance Contract:*
- *Total: 3,000 TND per year*
- *That's 250 TND per month*
- *For 25 extinguishers, that's 10 TND per extinguisher per month*
- *Less than 0.35 TND per day per extinguisher*

*For less than the cost of a coffee per day, you have complete peace of mind that all your fire safety equipment is professionally maintained and compliant. Does that seem unreasonable?"*

**Technique 4: Compare Apples to Apples**

*"I'd be happy to review the other quotation with you to ensure you're comparing the same thing. Often cheaper quotes:*
- *Use non-certified refilling materials*
- *Don't include proper documentation*
- *Have less frequent service visits*
- *Don't include genuine spare parts*
- *Have no warranty or support*
- *Aren't compliant with regulations*

*May I ask what's included in the other quote?"*

**Technique 5: Offer Options**

*"I understand budget constraints. Let me offer some options:*
- *We could phase the project over 2-3 months to spread the cost*
- *We could start with the most critical equipment and add more later*
- *For a longer commitment (3-5 year contract), I can offer better pricing*
- *We have payment plans available for larger projects*

*Which approach would work better for you?"*

**When to Discount:**
- Large volume or multi-year commitment
- Can genuinely adjust scope to reduce cost
- Strategic customer worth winning
- Meeting legitimate competitor pricing (within 15% authority, above needs approval)

**When NOT to Discount:**
- Customer just trying to negotiate with no real alternative
- Would set bad precedent for future business
- Already at minimum margin
- Discount would require compromising quality or compliance

**If Customer Still Says No on Price:**
- "I understand. We may not be the right fit for this project. Please keep us in mind for the future."
- "Our pricing reflects our commitment to quality and compliance. If you decide the other route isn't working out, we're here."
- Stay professional and friendly - they may return when cheap option fails

---

### Common Objection #2: "We Don't See the Value in Regular Maintenance"

**What They Really Mean:**
- Never had a fire, so seems unnecessary
- Don't understand regulations or compliance requirements
- Trying to cut costs
- Had service before but didn't see benefit

**How to Respond:**

**Technique 1: Legal/Regulatory Requirement**

*"I appreciate your question. Regular fire equipment maintenance isn't optional - it's required by Tunisian law and fire safety regulations.*

*Specifically:*
- *Fire extinguishers must be inspected annually minimum (every 6 months recommended)*
- *Hydrostatic testing is required every [X] years*
- *Equipment must have current service tags and documentation*
- *Insurance companies require proof of maintenance*

*If there's an incident and your equipment hasn't been maintained:*
- *Insurance may deny claims*
- *You could face regulatory fines*
- *Personal liability for management*
- *Criminal charges if someone is injured*

*Is compliance and protection worth more than [price] per year?"*

**Technique 2: Insurance Requirement**

*"Has your insurance company asked for proof of fire equipment maintenance? Most commercial policies require:*
- *Annual inspection certificates*
- *Maintenance records*
- *Compliance documentation*

*Without proper maintenance records, your insurance claim could be denied if there's a fire. We've seen this happen. Would you like me to prepare a maintenance schedule that satisfies your insurance requirements?"*

**Technique 3: Equipment Reliability**

*"Fire extinguishers are like car tires - they look fine until you need them in an emergency.*

*Without regular maintenance:*
- *Pressure can drop (extinguisher won't work)*
- *Seals can degrade (contents leak out)*
- *Contents can clump or separate (won't discharge properly)*
- *Valves can corrode (won't operate)*
- *Hoses can crack and fail*

*When there's a fire, there's no second chance. Maintenance ensures equipment works when lives depend on it.*

*Have you ever tested your extinguishers to see if they actually work?"*

**Technique 4: Cost Comparison**

*"Let's compare the costs:*
- *Annual maintenance: 2,500 TND*
- *Replacing all extinguishers because they weren't maintained: 15,000 TND*
- *Equipment failure during a fire: Potentially millions in damage, plus lives at risk*

*Maintenance is insurance against much larger costs. Which makes more business sense?"*

**Technique 5: Risk to People**

*"Beyond regulations and costs, this is about protecting your people. You have [X] employees who come to work trusting that you've provided a safe environment.*

*If there's a fire and the equipment doesn't work because it wasn't maintained, how would you feel? How would their families feel?*

*Fire safety is one area where cutting corners isn't worth it. Can we schedule your first inspection?"*

### Common Objection #3: "Competitors Are Cheaper / We Got a Lower Quote"

**What They Really Mean:**
- Testing to see if you'll discount
- Have a genuine cheaper alternative
- Using your quote to negotiate with others
- Budget-driven decision

**How to Respond:**

**Technique 1: Welcome Comparison**

*"I'm glad you're getting multiple quotes - that's smart business. Competition keeps us all honest.*

*However, I want to make sure you're comparing equal offerings. May I ask:*
- *Are they using certified products and materials?*
- *Do their technicians have proper certifications?*
- *What warranty do they offer?*
- *Do they provide compliance documentation?*
- *What's included vs. additional charges?*
- *How long have they been in business?*

*Sometimes what looks cheaper upfront costs more in the long run. Would you like me to review their quote with you?"*

**Technique 2: Differentiate on Service**

*"You're right, there are cheaper options in the market. Here's what differentiates SS+:*

*23 years in business - we'll be here tomorrow if you need us*
*Two locations - faster response, better coverage*
*Certified technicians - not just anyone with a wrench*
*WAVE PLUS system - you can track all your equipment history online with QR codes*
*06-month warranty - we stand behind our work*
*Genuine parts and certified materials - no shortcuts*
*Full compliance documentation - no surprises during inspections*

*The companies competing on price alone often can't offer these benefits. What's most important to you - lowest price or best service and reliability?"*

**Technique 3: Question the Competitor's Viability**

*"I respect that price matters. But I'd be concerned about a quote significantly lower than ours. We know our costs - certified materials, trained technicians, proper insurance, compliance requirements.*

*If someone is quoting substantially less, they're either:*
- *Cutting corners on quality or compliance*
- *Not properly insured*
- *Using non-certified materials*
- *Not factoring in all costs (hidden fees later)*
- *Not sustainable (may not be around for warranty or future service)*

*You're making a decision about life-safety equipment, not buying stationery. Is the cheapest really the wisest choice?"*

**Technique 4: Offer to Match (If Legitimate)**

*"If you have a legitimate written quote from a reputable company for the exact same scope and quality, I'd like to review it. We don't want to lose your business over a small price difference.*

*Keep in mind:*
- *I can offer up to 15% discount on my authority*
- *For larger discounts, I'd need manager approval but can request it*
- *We might be able to adjust scope or payment terms*
- *We value long-term relationships and will work to earn your business*

*Can you share the competitor's quote with me?"*

**When Competitor Really is Much Cheaper:**
- Don't badmouth them directly
- Focus on your value proposition
- Emphasize risks of cheap option
- Offer to be there when cheap option fails
- "We'd rather not get the business than compromise on quality. But please call us if things don't work out."

---

### Common Objection #4: "We Need to Think About It / Not Right Now"

**What They Really Mean:**
- Need time to consider (genuine)
- Need to discuss with others
- Avoiding confrontation (actually not interested)
- Budget isn't approved yet
- Waiting for competitor quotes
- There's an unstated concern

**How to Respond:**

**Technique 1: Uncover the Real Issue**

*"Of course, this is an important decision. To help you think it through, can I ask:*
- *What specific aspects do you need to think about?*
- *Is it the price, the scope, the timing, or something else?*
- *What information would help you make a decision?*
- *Is there anyone else involved in the decision?*
- *What's your decision-making timeline?*

*[Listen carefully - this often reveals the real objection]*

*If it's [concern they mentioned], let me address that right now..."*

**Technique 2: Create Urgency (If Genuine)**

*"I completely understand. While you're thinking it through, keep in mind:*
- *We have availability to start next week, but our schedule fills up quickly*
- *This quotation is valid for 30 days - prices may increase after that*
- *[If seasonal] The busy season is coming and lead times will increase*
- *[If compliance issue] Your next inspection is in [timeframe] - you'll need this completed*

*When do you think you'll have a decision?"*

**Technique 3: Offer Trial or Pilot**

*"I understand you want to be sure. What if we started with a smaller scope so you can experience our service quality?*

*For example:*
- *Start with just the most critical equipment*
- *One-year contract instead of three years*
- *Service just one location first*

*Once you see our work quality, you'll be confident expanding the scope. Would that help you move forward?"*

**Technique 4: Schedule Follow-Up**

*"Absolutely, take the time you need. When would be a good time for me to follow up?*
- *Would next week Tuesday work?*
- *Should I call you or would you prefer to call me?*
- *Is there anything I can provide to help with your decision?*

*[Get specific commitment, not vague 'we'll call you']*"

**If They're Being Evasive:**
*"I appreciate your time. I sense you may have some concerns you're not sharing. I'd rather know now so I can address them or respectfully move on. Is there something about our proposal that doesn't work for you?"*

---

### Common Objection #5: "We Don't Know Your Company"

**What They Really Mean:**
- Risk aversion - want proven vendor
- Had bad experience with unknown provider before
- Need reassurance
- Corporate policy to use established vendors

**How to Respond:**

**Technique 1: Company Credentials**

*"That's a fair concern, and I'm glad you're being careful. Let me share our background:*

*Sécurité Services Plus has been serving Tunisia since 2002 - that's 23 years in business.*
- *Two facilities (Sfax and Tunis) serving all of Tunisia*
- *Certified technicians with ongoing training*
- *Hundreds of satisfied customers across industries*
- *We serve [mention any recognizable customers if allowed]*
- *Member of [any trade associations]*
- *Fully licensed and insured*

*We're not a new company or a fly-by-night operation. We've built our reputation on quality and reliability.*"

**Technique 2: Offer References**

*"I understand you want assurance. I'd be happy to provide references from similar customers in your industry.*

*Would you like to:*
- *Speak with some of our current customers?*
- *Visit one of our facilities?*
- *See examples of our work?*
- *Review our certifications and credentials?*

*What would give you confidence in working with us?"*

**Technique 3: Low-Risk Trial**

*"I understand the hesitation to commit to an unknown provider. What if we structure this to minimize your risk?*

*We could:*
- *Start with a small project or pilot*
- *Shorter initial contract (1 year)*
- *Payment terms tied to satisfaction*
- *Clear performance metrics*

*Once you see our work quality and service, you'll be comfortable expanding the relationship. Fair enough?"*

**Technique 4: Demonstrate Technology**

*"What sets us apart - even from more established competitors - is our investment in technology.*

*Our WAVE PLUS system allows you to:*
- *Track all equipment history online*
- *Access service reports and certificates instantly*
- *Scan QR codes on equipment to see full maintenance history*
- *Get automated renewal reminders*
- *View your entire safety equipment inventory*

*We can give you a demo. Would you like to see it?"*

---

### Common Objection #6: "We'll Handle It Internally / We Have Someone Who Can Do This"

**What They Really Mean:**
- Trying to save money
- Have maintenance staff who can do basic work
- Overestimating internal capability
- Haven't considered compliance/certification requirements

**How to Respond:**

**Technique 1: Certification & Compliance**

*"That's great that you have capable staff. However, fire equipment maintenance requires:*
- *Certified technicians (not just general maintenance skills)*
- *Calibrated test equipment*
- *Access to certified refilling materials*
- *Authority to issue compliance certificates*
- *Liability insurance for life-safety work*

*Can your internal team provide these? Most importantly, if there's an incident, will insurance accept self-service documentation, or do they require certified third-party service?*

*Many of our customers have maintenance staff, but use us for fire equipment because of the specialized requirements and liability."*

**Technique 2: Core Business Focus**

*"I understand the desire to handle things internally. But let me ask:*
- *Is fire equipment maintenance your team's core competency?*
- *Do they have time to do it properly with their other responsibilities?*
- *What's the cost of their time vs. our service?*
- *What happens if they leave or are absent?*

*Most companies find it's more cost-effective to outsource specialized work like fire safety to experts, so their team can focus on core business activities.*

*Plus, we bring:*
- *Expertise from servicing hundreds of customers*
- *Latest knowledge on regulations and best practices*
- *Proper tools and materials*
- *Documentation that satisfies inspectors and insurers*

*Would it make sense to at least use us for annual certification, even if you do basic monthly checks internally?"*

**Technique 3: Offer Partnership**

*"That's fine. We can work alongside your team. Many customers:*
- *Have their staff do monthly visual checks*
- *Use us for annual comprehensive service and certification*
- *We can train your team on what to look for*
- *You get cost savings plus our expertise and certification*

*This gives you best of both worlds - cost control plus professional certification. Would that approach work?"*
