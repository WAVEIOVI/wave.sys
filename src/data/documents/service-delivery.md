# SECTION 1: SERVICE PLANNING & SCHEDULING

## 1.1 ANNUAL AND MONTHLY PLANNING

### Annual Service Planning

**Objective:** Plan all contracted services for the year to ensure timely delivery and optimal resource utilization.

**Process (Conducted in December for Following Year):**

**Step 1: MSA Review (Operations Responsible + Sales Responsible)**
- Review all active MSA
- List all customers with service frequencies:
  * Annual inspection customers
  * Semi-annual inspection customers
  * Quarterly inspection customers (fire alarms/detectors)
- Note MSA start/end dates and renewal schedules
- Calculate total annual service visits required

**Step 2: Geographic Mapping**
- Plot all customers on map by location
- Group into geographic zones:
  * **Sfax Region:** Within 50km of Sfax office
  * **Greater Sfax:** 50-120km from Sfax
  * **Tunis Region:** Within 50km of Tunis office
  * **Greater Tunis:** 50-120km from Tunis
  * **Other Regions:** Beyond 120km from either location

**Step 3: Resource Allocation**
- Assign customers to Sfax or Tunis team based on proximity
- Calculate technician capacity:
  * Average services per technician per day: 1-3 (depending on complexity)
  * Working days per month: ~22 days
  * Monthly capacity per technician: ~22-66 services
- Ensure capacity matches contracted commitments
- Identify need for temporary staff during peak periods

**Step 4: Create Annual Calendar**
- Schedule each customer's service months
- Distribute evenly across year (avoid bunching)
- Consider:
  * Customer preferences or blackout dates
  * Seasonal factors (weather, holidays)
  * MSA expiry dates (service before renewal discussion)
  * Balance workload across months

**Step 5: Document & Communicate**
- Load annual plan into WAVE PLUS
- Set automatic reminders for each service due date
- Share overview with Sales team (for renewal planning)
- Brief all team leaders on annual plan

---

### Monthly Service Planning

**Process (Last Week of Previous Month):**

**Step 1: Generate Monthly Service List (Operations Responsible)**
- WAVE PLUS generates list of all services due in upcoming month:
  * MSA services (from annual plan)
  * Ad-hoc services sold
  * Follow-up services (repairs, warranty work)
  * Overdue services from previous month

**Step 2: Monthly Planning Meeting (Operations Responsible + Team Leaders)**
- Review services due
- Identify any challenges:
  * Staff availability (vacation, training, sick leave)
  * Vehicle availability (maintenance scheduled?)
  * Material availability (refilling agents, parts)
  * Customer site access issues (shutdowns, holidays)
- Assign preliminary weekly allocations

**Step 3: Customer Confirmation**
- Contact customers to confirm access and schedule:
  * MSA customers: "Per your agreement, we'll be servicing your equipment during the week of [date]. Is this acceptable?"
  * New services: "We'd like to schedule your service for [date]. Does this work?"
- Note any customer-requested changes
- Update WAVE PLUS with confirmed dates

**Step 4: Finalize Monthly Schedule**
- Adjust for customer confirmations
- Ensure balanced workload
- Buffer days for emergencies and delays
- Communicate finalized schedule to all technicians

**Step 5: Material & Resource Check**
- Verify refilling materials stock adequate for month
- Order materials if needed (lead time considered)
- Ensure all vehicles are operational
- Confirm all equipment calibration is current
- Schedule any vehicle maintenance for light work weeks

---

## 1.2 WEEKLY ROUTE PLANNING

### Weekly Planning Meeting (Every Friday for Following Week)

**Attendees:**
- Operations Responsible (Mohamed CHRAITI)
- Team Leaders (all)
- Optionally: Technicians (for input)

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

**Agenda:**

**1. Review Current Week (10 min)**
- Services completed vs. planned
- Any issues encountered?
- Customer feedback received?
- Carryover to next week?

**2. Plan Next Week (25 min)**

**Step 1: List All Services Due**
- MSA services scheduled
- Ad-hoc services sold this week
- Emergency/urgent services
- Carryover from current week

**Step 2: Geographic Route Optimization**

**Principle:** Minimize travel time and costs by clustering services geographically

**Route Planning Rules:**
- Group services by zone (same area same day)
- Plan logical routes (avoid crisscrossing)
- Consider traffic patterns (leave early for distant sites)
- Allocate 30 minutes travel time between nearby sites, more for distant
- Maximum 1-3 services per technician per day depending on:
  * Service type (inspection faster than refilling)
  * Travel distances
  * Service complexity

**Example Good Route:**
- Monday AM: Customer A (Sfax Industrial Zone)
- Monday PM: Customer B (Sfax Industrial Zone) + Customer C (nearby)
- Travel: Minimal, all in same area

**Example Bad Route:**
- Monday AM: Customer A (North Sfax)
- Monday PM: Customer B (South Sfax, 40km away)
- Tuesday AM: Customer C (North Sfax again)
- Result: Wasted travel time and fuel

**Step 3: Technician Assignment**

**Assignment Criteria:**
- **Skills match:** Assign based on service complexity and technician competency
  * Senior technicians: Complex systems, large facilities, VIP customers
  * Junior technicians: Routine inspections, simple services (with senior oversight)
- **Workload balance:** Distribute work evenly
- **Customer familiarity:** Prefer technician who knows the customer (consistency)
- **Geography:** Assign technicians to their primary region when possible

**Team Structure:**
- **3-person teams (2 technicians + 1 team leader/technician) for:**
  * Large facilities (50+ extinguishers)
  * Complex installations requiring multiple skill sets
  * Extended-duration projects (2-15+ days)
  * High-value customers (quality assurance and backup coverage)
- **2-person teams (1 technician + 1 team leader/technician) for:**
  * Medium-sized facilities (20-50 extinguishers)
  * Training sessions (pairing less experienced with senior technicians)
  * Installations and complex repairs
  * Multi-day service projects
- **Solo technician for:**
  * Routine inspections (under 20 extinguishers)
  * Simple refilling jobs
  * Quick service calls
  * Level 3+ experienced technicians only

**Step 4: Vehicle Assignment**
- Match vehicle size to job requirements
- Ensure vehicle has necessary equipment and stock
- Consider: Some jobs need specific equipment (CO2 filling pump, testing gauges, etc.)

**Step 5: Create Daily Schedule for Each Technician**

**Daily Schedule Format:**

## 2.2 REFILLING & RECHARGING PROCEDURES

### Overview

**Refilling vs. Recharging:**
- **Refilling:** Replacing the extinguishing agent (powder, CO2, foam, water)
- **Recharging:** Refilling + restoring correct operating pressure

**When Required:**
- After use (even partial discharge)
- If pressure gauge shows low pressure
- If agent contaminated or expired
- As part of scheduled maintenance (annual internal examination)
- If seal broken for any reason

**Service Location:**
- **On-Site:** Accessible locations, customer preference
- **Workshop:** Large quantities, complex work, better controlled environment

**Safety Critical:** These procedures must be followed exactly. Improper refilling can result in equipment failure in emergency or injury to technician.

### CO2 Extinguisher Refilling Procedure

**Type:** Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
**Sizes:** 2kg, 5kg, 10kg (most common)
**Key Difference:** Weight-based (not pressure-based) - weigh to verify fill

⚠️ **SPECIAL SAFETY WARNINGS FOR CO2:**
- **Cold Burn Hazard:** CO2 is extremely cold (-78°C when released)
- **Asphyxiation Hazard:** CO2 displaces oxygen - work in ventilated area
- **Pressure Hazard:** Stored at high pressure (~60 bar at 20°C)

---

#### CO2 Extinguisher Refilling - Step by Step

**PREPARATION:**

1. **Verify Equipment:**
   - Confirm CO2 type (check label)
   - Note capacity (kg of CO2)
   - Check hydrostatic test date (critical for high pressure)
   - Inspect valve: CO2 valves are different from powder

2. **Gather Materials:**
   - CO2 gas supply (from Air Liquide cylinder or bulk tank)
   - CO2 filling equipment:
     * Filling hose with appropriate connectors
     * Valve wrench
     * Precision scale (accurate to ±10g minimum)
   - Replacement valve seals if needed
   - New safety pin and seal
   - New service tag
   - **Insulated gloves** (for cold protection)
   - Safety glasses

3. **Safety Setup:**
   - Work in well-ventilated area (preferably outdoors or with exhaust fan)
   - Ensure others aware you're working with CO2
   - Gloves and safety glasses ON

---

**STEP 1: DEPRESSURIZE & DISASSEMBLE (5 minutes)**

1. **Weigh First (Important):**
   - Weigh entire extinguisher as-is
   - Record weight
   - This tells you how much CO2 is inside

2. **Depressurize (if needed):**
   - If pressure remains, slowly discharge
   - Point away from people
   - ⚠️ **Cold Hazard:** Do not touch discharge horn during or immediately after
   - Continue until fully depressurized

3. **Remove Valve:**
   - Unscrew valve using appropriate wrench
   - Inspect valve seat and seals
   - Replace seals if damaged or compressed

---

**STEP 2: INSPECT CYLINDER (5 minutes)**

☐ **Critical Inspection (CO2 cylinders more vulnerable):**
  - Interior walls: No corrosion, pitting, or damage
  - Exterior: No dents, bulges, or damage
  - Threads: Not damaged
  - **Hydrostatic test date:** MUST be within validity
    * First test: 10 years from manufacture
    * Subsequent: Every 5 years
  - **If any doubt about cylinder integrity: DO NOT REFILL - Replace cylinder**

---

**STEP 3: REFILL WITH CO2 (15-20 minutes)**

**CO2 Filling Method:**

1. **Setup Scale:**
   - Place extinguisher on scale
   - Tare (zero) the scale, OR note empty weight from cylinder label

2. **Connect CO2 Supply:**
   - Connect filling hose to CO2 source (regulated supply)
   - Connect other end to extinguisher valve opening
   - Ensure connections tight (leaks waste expensive CO2)

3. **Calculate Target Weight:**
   - Check extinguisher label for "CO2 Charge Weight"
   - Example: 5kg extinguisher = 5kg of CO2
   - Target total weight = Empty cylinder weight + CO2 charge weight
   - Example: If empty cylinder = 8kg, target total = 8kg + 5kg = 13kg

4. **Fill Slowly:**
   - Open CO2 supply valve
   - **Fill slowly** - CO2 liquid fills cylinder, takes time
   - Monitor scale continuously
   - As weight approaches target, slow down filling (easy to overfill)
   - ⚠️ **Cold Formation:** Frost will form on cylinder exterior (normal)
   - ⚠️ **Never overfill:** Excess pressure can rupture cylinder as it warms

5. **Stop at Target Weight:**
   - When target weight ±50g reached, close CO2 supply
   - Allow cylinder to warm to ambient temperature (5-10 minutes)
   - Frost will dissipate
   - Re-weigh: Weight may change slightly as temperature stabilizes
   - Adjust if necessary (add or remove small amount)

---

**STEP 4: REASSEMBLE & SEAL (10 minutes)**

1. **Install Valve:**
   - Install new seals if old ones compressed
   - Thread valve carefully
   - Tighten securely

2. **Final Weight Verification:**
   - Weigh complete assembly
   - Compare to nameplate "charged weight"
   - **Must be within ±2% of rated weight**
   - If under: Needs more CO2
   - If over: Slightly over-pressurized (not safe - must correct)

3. **Install Pin & Seal:**
   - New safety pin
   - Tamper-evident seal
   - Service tag with date and technician ID

---

**STEP 5: QUALITY CHECK (5 minutes)**

☐ **Weight Verification:**
  - Final weight matches specification
  - Documented in WAVE PLUS

☐ **Valve Check:**
  - Securely tightened
  - No visible leaks
  - Discharge horn secure

☐ **Safety Devices:**
  - Pin and seal properly installed
  - Tag complete and legible

☐ **Allow to Stabilize:**
  - Let cylinder reach room temperature before releasing to customer
  - Re-verify weight after stabilization

**2. EMPTY & CLEAN:**
   - Pour out old foam solution
   - Rinse cylinder thoroughly with clean water
   - Remove any residue or debris
   - Inspect interior for corrosion
   - Dry completely before refilling

**3. PREPARE FOAM SOLUTION:**

**Mixing Ratio (Example for 6% AFFF):**
- 6L extinguisher needs:
  * 6% concentrate = 0.36L (360ml) concentrate
  * Water = 5.64L
  * Total = 6L solution

**Mixing Procedure:**
1. Measure concentrate accurately
2. Add water to mixing container first
3. Add concentrate to water (not reverse)
4. Mix thoroughly but gently (avoid excess foaming during mixing)
5. Verify total volume correct

**4. FILL CYLINDER:**
   - Pour mixed solution into cylinder using funnel
   - Fill to correct level (measure or weigh)
   - Leave expansion space as per specification

**5. REASSEMBLE, PRESSURIZE, SEAL:**
   - Same as powder extinguisher
   - Pressurize with nitrogen (not air - causes degradation)
   - Typical pressure: 10-12 bar (check label)

**6. SPECIAL NOTES FOR FOAM:**
   - ☐ Foam solution has shelf life (typically 5 years) - note expiry date
   - ☐ Temperature sensitive - store properly
   - ☐ Label must show: Type of foam, concentration %, mix date, expiry date
   - ☐ Cylinder must be inverted annually to keep foam mixed (instruct customer)

#### Clean Agent Refilling - Key Points

**Similar to CO2 Method:**
- Weight-based filling
- High pressure
- Specialized filling equipment required
- Must use exact agent type (FM-200 cannot be substituted with other agents)

**Procedure:**
1. Depressurize and disassemble (same as CO2)
2. Inspect cylinder (critical - high value)
3. Weigh and record empty weight
4. Connect to clean agent supply (dedicated filling equipment)
5. Fill to specification weight
6. Reassemble and verify weight
7. Pressure will build as agent warms (normal)
8. Quality check and document

**Special Considerations:**
- Clean agents regulated for environmental reasons - proper handling required
- Very expensive - avoid waste
- Specialized training recommended
- Consider partnering with specialist if not frequent

### CHOOSING THE RIGHT METHOD

**Decision Factors:**

| Factor | Method 1: SS+ Collection | Method 2: Customer Collection |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Site Size** | Small-Medium (1-50 units) | Any size |
| **Customer Preference** | Convenience, full service | Cost savings, control |
| **Customer Staff Availability** | Not required | Required |
| **Site Complexity** | Multi-building, spread out | Centralized, single area |
| **Security Requirements** | Escort required | Can minimize SS+ site access |
| **Budget** | Higher cost (full service) | Lower cost (reduced service) |
| **Relationship** | Build relationship (we do everything) | Collaborative (customer involved) |

**Communication During Quotation:**
Always present both options to customer:
- *"We offer two service methods: We can collect and return all equipment (full service), or if you prefer, your staff can bring equipment to our work zone (reduced cost). Which would you prefer?"*

**Documentation:**
- Note chosen method in MSA or service agreement
- Confirm method before each service visit
- Be flexible: Method can change per customer request

---

### SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

**Multi-Day Projects (Extended Duration):**
- Work zone remains setup for duration (secure overnight)
- Coordinate with customer for security (lock tent, secure equipment)
- Equipment collected Day 1, serviced over multiple days, returned final day
- OR equipment serviced in batches (collect section 1, service, return; collect section 2, etc.)

**Weather Challenges:**
- Rain: Postpone outdoor work or require covered area
- Extreme heat: Provide shade for technician (tent), hydration, breaks
- Cold: Appropriate clothing, consider indoor work zone

**Security Concerns:**
- High-value customer sites: Coordinate security access
- Escorted work: Customer provides escort for collection/return
- Equipment tracking: Extra vigilance to ensure no equipment lost/misplaced

**Customer Training Opportunity:**
- When using Method 2 (Customer Collection), offer brief training:
  * How to properly remove equipment from brackets
  * How to check equipment condition (basic visual inspection)
  * Opportunity to educate customer staff on fire safety
