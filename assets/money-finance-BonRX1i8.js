\r
**Voided/Cancelled Invoices:**\r

\r
**Credit Notes:**\r

## 2.3 REVENUE RECOGNITION\r
\r

  * Method 2: Upon completion of each scheduled service\r
  * SS+ uses Method 2 for simplicity\r
\r
**Product Sales:**\r
- When products delivered and customer takes possession\r
- For ex-works sales: When customer picks up\r
\r
**Deposit/Advance Payments:**\r
- Recorded as "Customer Deposits" (liability)\r
- Not recognized as revenue until service/delivery completed\r
- Converted to revenue when final invoice issued\r
\r

**Step 3: Issue Credit Note**\r
- Admin & Finance Responsable creates credit note in Softcom\r
- Credit note must reference:\r
  * Original invoice number and date\r

  * Applied to outstanding balance (if any)\r
  * Applied to next invoice\r
  * Refund issued (requires Manager approval - rare)\r
- Confirm customer understanding and acceptance\r
\r
**Step 5: Accounting Treatment**\r
- Record credit note in Softcom\r
- Reduces revenue in current period\r
- Reduces accounts receivable for customer\r

\r
### Credit Note Format\r
\r
**Credit Note Must Include:**\r

- Original invoice number and date being credited\r
- Clear reason for credit\r

\r
### Debit Notes (Rare)\r
\r
**When Issued:**\r
- Undercharged customer (invoice too low)\r
- Additional services provided after original invoice\r
- Correction to customer's benefit that requires adjustment\r
\r
**Process:**\r
- Generally prefer to issue new invoice for additional charges\r
- Debit note used only if specifically adjusting previous invoice\r

\`\`\`\r
SS+ Bank Reconciliation - [Bank Name] - [Month Year]\r
\r
Balance per Bank Statement (ending [date])          [Amount] TND\r
\r
Add: Deposits in Transit\r
     [Date] - [Description]                         [Amount]\r
     [Date] - [Description]                         [Amount]\r
     Total Deposits in Transit:                     [Amount] TND\r
\r
Less: Outstanding Checks\r
     [Check#] - [Date] - [Payee]                   ([Amount])\r
     [Check#] - [Date] - [Payee]                   ([Amount])\r
     Total Outstanding Checks:                     ([Amount]) TND\r
\r
Adjusted Bank Balance:                              [Amount] TND\r
\r
Balance per Books (Softcom)                         [Amount] TND\r
\r
Add/Less: Bank Items Not Yet Recorded\r
     Bank charges                                   ([Amount])\r
     Bank interest                                   [Amount]\r
     [Other items]                                   [Amount]\r
\r
Adjusted Book Balance:                              [Amount] TND\r
\r
DIFFERENCE (should be ZERO):                        [Amount] TND\r
\r
If difference is not zero, explain:\r
_____________________________________________________________\r
\r
Prepared by: _________________ Date: _______\r
Reviewed by: _________________ Date: _______\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
**Step 7: Investigate Differences**\r
- Any difference must be investigated and explained\r
- Common causes:\r
  * Timing differences (resolved next period)\r
  * Recording errors in books\r
  * Bank errors (contact bank)\r
  * Unauthorized transactions (serious - escalate immediately)\r
  * Duplicate entries\r
  * Math errors\r
\r
**Step 8: Record Adjustments**\r
- Enter all bank charges/fees in Softcom\r
- Record bank interest earned\r
- Record any items found on statement not in books\r
- Correct any errors discovered\r
- Post all adjustments before finalizing reconciliation\r
\r
**Step 9: Management Review**\r
- Admin & Finance Responsable signs completed reconciliation\r
- File reconciliation with supporting documents\r
- Report any unusual items or concerns to Manager\r
- Large or unusual transactions explained in writing\r
\r
### Reconciliation Red Flags\r
\r
**Immediate Escalation to Manager If:**\r
- Reconciliation difference over 500 TND unexplained\r
- Unauthorized withdrawal or check\r
- Missing deposits\r
- Duplicate payments\r
- Checks cleared that were never issued\r
- Evidence of potential fraud or error\r
\r
### Outstanding Items Follow-Up\r
\r
**Outstanding Checks:**\r
- Review list monthly\r
- Checks over 60 days: Contact payee to verify received\r
- Checks over 90 days: Consider voiding and reissuing\r
- Very old checks (6+ months): May need to write back into books (per accounting rules)\r
\r
**Deposits in Transit:**\r
- Should clear within 1-3 business days\r
- If not cleared within 5 days: Contact bank to investigate\r
- If lost: Provide copy of deposit slip to bank for tracing\r
\r
### Dual Control Procedures\r
\r
**Segregation of Duties:**\r
- Person preparing reconciliation should NOT:\r
  * Be sole check signer\r
  * Handle customer payments without oversight\r
  * Process all bank deposits alone\r
  * Have sole access to online banking\r
\r
**Best Practice:**\r
- Reconciliation prepared by Admin & Finance Responsable\r
- Sample review by Manager or external bookkeeper\r
- Surprise reconciliations (quarterly) by independent person\r
- Bank statements sent to Manager's email (not just finance staff)\r

# Section 5: PRICING & MARGINS\r
\r
## 5.1 COST STRUCTURE & MARKUP STRATEGY\r
\r
### Understanding Our Costs\r
\r
**Product Costs (Fire Equipment, PPE, Workwear, Signage):**\r
\r
**Direct Product Costs:**\r
- Purchase price from supplier (cost of goods)\r
- Import duties/taxes (if imported)\r
- Freight/shipping to our facility\r
- Customs clearance fees\r
\r
**Formula:**\r
\`\`\`\r
Landed Cost = Purchase Price + Duties + Freight + Clearance\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
**Service Costs (Inspection, Maintenance, Installation):**\r
\r
**Direct Service Costs:**\r
- Technician labor (hourly rate or daily rate)\r
- Refilling materials (powder, CO2, foam, etc.)\r
- Replacement parts (seals, valves, gauges, hoses)\r
- Consumables (tags, stickers, service documentation)\r
- Vehicle fuel for travel\r
- Equipment/tools (depreciation allocated)\r
\r
**Indirect Costs (Overhead):**\r
- Facility rent (workshop, warehouse, office)\r
- Utilities (electricity, water, internet, phone)\r
- Vehicle maintenance and insurance\r
- Management and admin salaries\r
- Insurance (liability, workers comp)\r
- Marketing and business development\r
- IT systems (Softcom, WAVE PLUS)\r
- Professional fees (legal, accounting)\r
- Training and certification\r
\r
**Overhead Allocation:**\r
- Total overhead costs per month: [Amount TND]\r
- Divided by: Productive hours or revenue (allocation method)\r
- Overhead rate: [X]% of direct costs or [Amount TND] per hour\r
\r
### Markup Strategy by Product/Service Type\r
\r
**Standard Markup Percentages:**\r
\r
| Product/Service Category | Target Markup | Minimum Acceptable | Notes |\r
|--------------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------|\r
| **Fire Extinguishers (Product)** | 35-45% | 25% | Higher for specialty types |\r
| **Fire Hose Reels** | 40-50% | 30% | Includes installation markup |\r
| **PPE - Standard Items** | 30-40% | 20% | Competitive market |\r
| **PPE - Specialty Items** | 45-60% | 35% | Less competition |\r
| **Workwear - Standard** | 30-40% | 25% | Volume sensitive |\r
| **Workwear - Custom/Branded** | 50-70% | 40% | Value-added service |\r
| **Safety Signage - Standard** | 40-50% | 30% | Production cost plus |\r
| **Safety Signage - Custom** | 60-80% | 50% | Design + production |\r
| **Inspection Services** | 50-60% | 40% | Labor + overhead |\r
| **Maintenance/Refilling** | 40-50% | 30% | Materials + labor |\r
| **Installation Services** | 50-65% | 40% | Skilled labor premium |\r
| **AMC (Annual Contracts)** | 35-45% | 25% | Discounted for commitment |\r
\r
**Markup Calculation:**\r
\`\`\`\r
Selling Price = Cost × (1 + Markup %)\r
\r
Example:\r
Fire extinguisher cost: 100 TND\r
Markup: 40%\r
Selling Price = 100 × (1.40) = 140 TND\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
**Or Using Margin:**\r
\`\`\`\r
Selling Price = Cost ÷ (1 - Margin %)\r
\r
If target margin is 30%:\r
Selling Price = 100 ÷ (1 - 0.30) = 100 ÷ 0.70 = 142.86 TND\r
\r
Note: \r
Markup 40% ≈ Margin 28.6%\r
Markup 50% = Margin 33.3%\r
Markup 100% = Margin 50%\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
### Pricing Considerations\r
\r
**Factors That Increase Pricing:**\r
- Specialized/technical products\r
- Rush delivery/emergency service\r
- Remote locations (travel time)\r
- After-hours service\r
- Warranty/guarantee provisions\r
- Technical complexity\r
- Certification requirements\r
- Custom specifications\r
\r
**Factors That May Decrease Pricing:**\r
- Large volume orders\r
- Long-term contracts (predictable revenue)\r
- Off-peak scheduling flexibility\r
- Repeat customers (relationship value)\r
- Competitive pressure\r
- Market conditions\r
- Strategic customer (reference value)\r
\r
**Competitive Pricing Analysis:**\r
- Monitor competitor pricing (quarterly)\r
- Understand our positioning (premium, mid-market, or value)\r
- Price competitively where differentiation is low\r
- Price for value where we have advantages (quality, service, expertise)\r
\r
### Pricing Psychology\r
\r
**Price Points:**\r
- Use psychological pricing: 995 TND instead of 1,000 TND\r
- Bundle pricing: Package multiple services for perceived value\r
- Tiered pricing: Good-Better-Best options\r
\r
**Volume Discounts (Standard Schedule):**\r
\r
| Quantity Range | Discount from List Price |\r
|----------------|-------------------------|\r
| 1-9 units | 0% (list price) |\r
| 10-49 units | 5-8% |\r
| 50-99 units | 10-12% |\r
| 100-499 units | 15-18% |\r
| 500+ units | 20%+ (quote basis) |\r
\r
*Note: Specific discount percentage within range depends on product category and margins*\r

\r
## 5.3 DISCOUNT IMPACT ANALYSIS\r
\r
### Understanding Discount Impact on Profitability\r
\r
**Critical Concept:** Discounts have magnified impact on profit\r
\r
**Example Analysis:**\r
\r
**Scenario: Fire Extinguisher Sale**\r
- Cost: 100 TND\r
- Standard Price: 140 TND (40% markup, 28.6% margin)\r
- Profit: 40 TND\r
\r
**Discount Impact:**\r
\r
| Discount % | Selling Price | Profit | Profit Reduction | Sales Increase Needed to Maintain Profit |\r
|------------|---------------|--------|------------------|------------------------------------------|\r
| 0% | 140 TND | 40 TND | 0% | 0% |\r
| 5% | 133 TND | 33 TND | -17.5% | +21% |\r
| 10% | 126 TND | 26 TND | -35% | +54% |\r
| 12.5% | 122.5 TND | 22.5 TND | -43.8% | +78% |\r
| 15% | 119 TND | 19 TND | -52.5% | +111% |\r
| 20% | 112 TND | 12 TND | -70% | +233% |\r
| 25% | 105 TND | 5 TND | -87.5% | +700% |\r
\r
**Key Insight:** A 12.5% discount reduces profit by 43.8% and requires 78% more sales volume to maintain same total profit!\r
\r
### Discount Authorization with Profit Awareness\r
\r
**Sales Representatives (up to 12.5% discount):**\r
- Understand: This discount reduces profit significantly\r
- Use for: Large volumes, strategic customers, competitive wins\r
- Don't use for: Just to close easy sale or avoid negotiation\r
\r
**Sales Responsable (up to 20% discount):**\r
- Requires strong justification\r
- Typically needs: Very large order, multi-year contract, strategic account\r
- Analyzes: Lifetime customer value, not just single transaction\r
\r
**Manager (above 20% discount):**\r
- Exceptional circumstances only\r
- Examples: Major contract win, market entry, capacity utilization\r
- Full analysis required\r
\r
### Discount Alternatives\r
\r
**Instead of Price Discount, Consider:**\r
\r
1. **Value-Added Services:**\r
   - Free delivery/installation\r
   - Extended warranty\r
   - Priority service scheduling\r
   - Free training session\r
   - Bundled inspection services\r

### Key Aging Metrics\r
\r
**Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):**\r
\`\`\`\r
DSO = (Accounts Receivable / Revenue) × Number of Days\r
\r
Example:\r
AR Balance: 50,000 TND\r
Monthly Revenue: 100,000 TND\r
DSO = (50,000 / 100,000) × 30 days = 15 days\r
\r
Target DSO: Under 45 days\r
Acceptable: 45-60 days\r
Concerning: Over 60 days\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
**Collection Effectiveness Index (CEI):**\r
\`\`\`\r
CEI = (Beginning AR + Credit Sales - Ending AR) / (Beginning AR + Credit Sales - Current AR) × 100%\r
\r
Target CEI: Over 85%\r
Good: 80-85%\r
Needs Improvement: Under 80%\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
**Percentage Overdue:**\r
\`\`\`\r
% Overdue = (Overdue AR / Total AR) × 100%\r
\r
Target: Under 25%\r
Acceptable: 25-35%\r
Concerning: Over 35%\r
\`\`\`\r

## 6.4 BAD DEBT MANAGEMENT\r
\r
### Identifying Potential Bad Debts\r
\r
**Warning Signs:**\r
- Over 90 days overdue with no payment or contact\r
- Customer not responding to calls/emails\r
- Business appears closed or relocated\r
- Dishonored checks or traites\r
- Customer declares bankruptcy\r
- Legal disputes with customer\r
- Other creditors also pursuing customer\r
\r
**Proactive Identification:**\r
- Monthly review of 60+ days aging\r
- Quarterly bad debt reserve analysis\r
- Industry news monitoring for customer difficulties\r
\r
### Bad Debt Reserve (Allowance for Doubtful Accounts)\r
\r
**Accounting Treatment:**\r
- Establish reserve based on aging and history\r
- Reserve reduces reported AR and profit\r
- Acts as buffer for eventual write-offs\r
\r
**Reserve Calculation Method:**\r
\r
| Aging Category | Reserve % |\r
|----------------|-----------|\r
| Current | 1% |\r
| 1-30 days | 5% |\r
| 31-60 days | 15% |\r
| 61-90 days | 40% |\r
| 90-180 days | 75% |\r
| Over 180 days | 100% |\r
\r
**Example:**\r
\`\`\`\r
Aging Category | AR Amount | Reserve % | Reserve Amount\r
_______________|___________|___________|_______________\r
Current        | 50,000    | 1%        | 500\r
1-30 days      | 20,000    | 5%        | 1,000\r
31-60 days     | 8,000     | 15%       | 1,200\r
61-90 days     | 3,000     | 40%       | 1,200\r
90-180 days    | 2,000     | 75%       | 1,500\r
Over 180 days  | 1,000     | 100%      | 1,000\r
_______________|___________|___________|_______________\r
TOTAL          | 84,000    |           | 6,400 TND\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
Reserve of 6,400 TND represents expected bad debt.\r
\r
### Write-Off Process\r
\r
**When to Write Off:**\r
- All collection efforts exhausted\r
- Legal action uneconomical or unsuccessful\r
- Customer bankrupt or untraceable\r
- Amount uncollectible beyond reasonable doubt\r
- Usually: Over 180 days with no recovery prospect\r
\r
**Write-Off Authorization:**\r
\r
| Amount | Required Approval |\r
|--------|------------------|\r
| Up to 2,000 TND | Both Managers |\r
| Over 2,000 TND | Both Managers + documentation + legal opinion |\r
\r
**Write-Off Documentation Required:**\r
- Complete collection history (all contacts, letters, calls)\r
- Customer financial status (bankrupt, closed, etc.)\r
- Legal advice (if applicable)\r
- Cost-benefit analysis of further action\r
- Recommendation memo\r
- Approval signatures\r
\r
**Accounting Entry:**\r
\`\`\`\r
Debit: Bad Debt Expense (or Allowance for Doubtful Accounts)\r
Credit: Accounts Receivable (specific customer)\r
\r
Effect: Removes AR from books, recognizes loss\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
**Post Write-Off Actions:**\r
- Customer file marked "Bad Debt - No Credit Ever"\r
- Block in Softcom system (cannot create orders)\r
- Continue legal pursuit if amount significant (write-off is accounting, not forgiveness)\r
- If customer later pays: Record as "Bad Debt Recovery" (income)\r
\r
### Legal Action Decision\r
\r
**When to Pursue Legally:**\r
- Amount over 2,000 TND (typically)\r
- Customer has assets to recover\r
- Clear debt with documentation\r
- Customer unresponsive to normal collection\r
\r
**Legal Action Process:**\r
1. **Consultation:** Meet with attorney\r
2. **Cost Analysis:** Legal fees vs. recovery probability\r
3. **Approval:** Both Managers approve\r
4. **Demand Letter:** Attorney sends formal demand\r
5. **Filing:** Lawsuit filed if no response\r
6. **Judgment:** Court judgment obtained\r
7. **Enforcement:** Seizure, garnishment, etc.\r
8. **Collection:** Payment recovered (minus legal costs)\r
\r
**Cost Considerations:**\r
- Attorney fees: [Amount range]\r
- Court fees: [Amount]\r
- Time investment: Significant\r
- Recovery rate: Typically 30-70% of debt\r
- Timeline: 6-18 months or more\r
\r
**Alternatives to Litigation:**\r
- Mediation or arbitration\r
- Payment plan under legal agreement\r
- Partial settlement (take less, close case)\r
- Collection agency (they take percentage, typically 25-40%)\r
\r
### Prevention Better Than Cure\r
\r
**Best Practices to Minimize Bad Debt:**\r
1. **Strong Credit Evaluation:** Don't extend credit to high-risk customers\r
2. **Clear Terms:** Payment terms understood and agreed upfront\r
3. **Prompt Invoicing:** Invoice immediately upon service/delivery\r
4. **Proactive Collection:** Start follow-up before overdue\r
5. **Relationship Management:** Good communication reduces problems\r
6. **Early Escalation:** Don't let problems age\r
7. **Credit Limit Discipline:** Enforce limits strictly\r
8. **Diversification:** Don't over-concentrate AR in few customers\r
9. **Deposits for Risk:** Require deposits for new/risky customers\r
10. **Regular Reviews:** Monthly AR review, adjust credit as needed\r

### Cash Flow Forecast Assumptions\r
\r
**Inflows (Customer Payments):**\r
- Based on current AR aging\r
- Expected collection percentages:\r
  * Current: 90% paid within terms\r
  * 1-30 days: 50% collected per week\r
  * 31-60 days: 25% collected per week\r
  * 61+ days: 10% collected per week\r
- New sales forecast (conservative estimate)\r
- Large expected payments noted specifically\r
\r
**Outflows (Payments):**\r
- Supplier payments: Per payment terms and scheduled payment runs\r
- Payroll: Fixed date each month\r
- Rent: Monthly fixed dates\r
- Taxes: Per tax calendar\r
- Loan payments: Per loan schedule\r
- Other: Historical average or known commitments\r
\r
### Cash Flow Actions\r
\r
**If Surplus Cash Projected:**\r
- Negotiate early payment discounts with suppliers\r
- Pay down debt (if economical)\r
- Build emergency reserve\r
- Consider investments (equipment, marketing, etc.)\r
- Owner distributions (if appropriate)\r
\r
**If Cash Shortage Projected:**\r
- Accelerate collections (contact customers, offer discounts)\r
- Delay non-critical payments (negotiate with suppliers)\r
- Reduce discretionary spending\r
- Consider short-term financing (overdraft, short-term loan)\r
- Defer owner drawings\r
- Adjust payment terms with suppliers\r
- Increase deposit requirements from customers\r
\r
**Minimum Cash Balance Target:** 20,000 TND  \r
**Comfortable Cash Balance:** 40,000+ TND  \r
**Alert Level:** Below 25,000 TND - Managers notified immediately\r
\r
---\r
\r
## 9.3 CAPITAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS\r
\r
### Capital Expenditure (CapEx) Definition\r
\r
**Capital Expenditures:** Purchases of long-term assets (vehicles, equipment, facilities, IT systems)\r
\r
**Characteristics:**\r
- Cost over 2,000 TND typically\r
- Useful life over 1 year\r
- Creates or improves asset\r
- Capitalized (depreciated over time vs. expensed immediately)\r
\r
### CapEx Approval Process\r
\r
**Proposal Requirements:**\r
1. **Business Case:**\r
   - What: Description of asset/project\r
   - Why: Business justification (revenue growth, cost saving, replacement, compliance)\r
   - Cost: Purchase price + installation + training\r
   - Timing: When needed, when funds required\r
\r
2. **Financial Analysis:**\r
   - Total investment required\r
   - Expected benefits (revenue increase, cost savings)\r
   - Payback period (how long to recover investment)\r
   - Return on Investment (ROI) percentage\r
   - Impact on cash flow\r
\r
3. **Alternatives Considered:**\r
   - Other options evaluated\r
   - Why this option chosen\r
   - Lease vs. buy analysis (if applicable)\r
\r
**Approval Authority:**\r
\r
| Investment Amount | Required Approval | Documentation |\r
|------------------|------------------|---------------|\r
| 2,000 - 10,000 TND | Operations Responsable + Sales Responsable | Business case email |\r
| 10,001 - 30,000 TND | Above + Manager approval | Formal proposal document |\r
| Over 30,000 TND | Both Managers | Comprehensive analysis + presentation |\r
\r
### CapEx Evaluation Criteria\r
\r
**Payback Period:**\r
\`\`\`\r
Payback Period = Investment Cost / Annual Benefit\r
\r
Example:\r
New vehicle cost: 30,000 TND\r
Annual fuel savings vs. old vehicle: 3,000 TND\r
Payback = 30,000 / 3,000 = 10 years (too long - may not justify)\r
\r
But if revenue generation capability: 15,000 TND/year additional\r
Payback = 30,000 / 15,000 = 2 years (reasonable)\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
**Return on Investment (ROI):**\r
\`\`\`\r
ROI = (Annual Benefit / Investment Cost) × 100%\r
\r
Example:\r
Investment: 20,000 TND\r
Annual benefit: 6,000 TND\r
ROI = (6,000 / 20,000) × 100% = 30% ROI\r
\r
Target ROI: Minimum 20% for discretionary investments\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
**Strategic Value:**\r
- Competitive advantage gained\r
- Customer satisfaction improvement\r
- Employee productivity/satisfaction\r
- Future opportunity creation\r
- Risk reduction\r
\r
### CapEx Budget Management\r
\r
**Annual CapEx Budget:**\r
- Total planned: [Amount TND]\r
- By category:\r
  * Vehicles: [Amount]\r
  * Equipment: [Amount]\r
  * IT: [Amount]\r
  * Facilities: [Amount]\r
\r
**Mid-Year Review:**\r
- Assess spending vs. budget\r
- Evaluate whether planned investments still needed\r
- Consider new priority investments\r
- Adjust if business conditions changed\r
\r
**Unbudgeted CapEx:**\r
- Emergency replacements (vehicle breakdown, equipment failure)\r
- Unexpected opportunities (great deal, customer requirement)\r
- Requires Manager approval even if under normal authority limit\r
