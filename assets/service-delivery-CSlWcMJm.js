# SECTION 1: SERVICE PLANNING & SCHEDULING\r
\r
## 1.1 ANNUAL AND MONTHLY PLANNING\r
\r
### Annual Service Planning\r
\r
**Objective:** Plan all contracted services for the year to ensure timely delivery and optimal resource utilization.\r
\r
**Process (Conducted in December for Following Year):**\r
\r
**Step 1: MSA Review (Operations Responsible + Sales Responsible)**\r
- Review all active MSA\r
- List all customers with service frequencies:\r
  * Annual inspection customers\r
  * Semi-annual inspection customers\r
  * Quarterly inspection customers (fire alarms/detectors)\r
- Note MSA start/end dates and renewal schedules\r
- Calculate total annual service visits required\r
\r
**Step 2: Geographic Mapping**\r
- Plot all customers on map by location\r
- Group into geographic zones:\r
  * **Sfax Region:** Within 50km of Sfax office\r
  * **Greater Sfax:** 50-120km from Sfax\r
  * **Tunis Region:** Within 50km of Tunis office\r
  * **Greater Tunis:** 50-120km from Tunis\r
  * **Other Regions:** Beyond 120km from either location\r
\r
**Step 3: Resource Allocation**\r
- Assign customers to Sfax or Tunis team based on proximity\r
- Calculate technician capacity:\r
  * Average services per technician per day: 1-3 (depending on complexity)\r
  * Working days per month: ~22 days\r
  * Monthly capacity per technician: ~22-66 services\r
- Ensure capacity matches contracted commitments\r
- Identify need for temporary staff during peak periods\r
\r
**Step 4: Create Annual Calendar**\r
- Schedule each customer's service months\r
- Distribute evenly across year (avoid bunching)\r
- Consider:\r
  * Customer preferences or blackout dates\r
  * Seasonal factors (weather, holidays)\r
  * MSA expiry dates (service before renewal discussion)\r
  * Balance workload across months\r
\r
**Step 5: Document & Communicate**\r
- Load annual plan into WAVE PLUS\r
- Set automatic reminders for each service due date\r
- Share overview with Sales team (for renewal planning)\r
- Brief all team leaders on annual plan\r
\r
---\r
\r
### Monthly Service Planning\r
\r
**Process (Last Week of Previous Month):**\r
\r
**Step 1: Generate Monthly Service List (Operations Responsible)**\r
- WAVE PLUS generates list of all services due in upcoming month:\r
  * MSA services (from annual plan)\r
  * Ad-hoc services sold\r
  * Follow-up services (repairs, warranty work)\r
  * Overdue services from previous month\r
\r
**Step 2: Monthly Planning Meeting (Operations Responsible + Team Leaders)**\r
- Review services due\r
- Identify any challenges:\r
  * Staff availability (vacation, training, sick leave)\r
  * Vehicle availability (maintenance scheduled?)\r
  * Material availability (refilling agents, parts)\r
  * Customer site access issues (shutdowns, holidays)\r
- Assign preliminary weekly allocations\r
\r
**Step 3: Customer Confirmation**\r
- Contact customers to confirm access and schedule:\r
  * MSA customers: "Per your agreement, we'll be servicing your equipment during the week of [date]. Is this acceptable?"\r
  * New services: "We'd like to schedule your service for [date]. Does this work?"\r
- Note any customer-requested changes\r
- Update WAVE PLUS with confirmed dates\r
\r
**Step 4: Finalize Monthly Schedule**\r
- Adjust for customer confirmations\r
- Ensure balanced workload\r
- Buffer days for emergencies and delays\r
- Communicate finalized schedule to all technicians\r
\r
**Step 5: Material & Resource Check**\r
- Verify refilling materials stock adequate for month\r
- Order materials if needed (lead time considered)\r
- Ensure all vehicles are operational\r
- Confirm all equipment calibration is current\r
- Schedule any vehicle maintenance for light work weeks\r

## 1.2 WEEKLY ROUTE PLANNING\r
\r
### Weekly Planning Meeting (Every Friday for Following Week)\r
\r
**Attendees:**\r
- Operations Responsible (Mohamed CHRAITI)\r
- Team Leaders (all)\r
- Optionally: Technicians (for input)\r
\r
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes\r
\r
**Agenda:**\r
\r
**1. Review Current Week (10 min)**\r
- Services completed vs. planned\r
- Any issues encountered?\r
- Customer feedback received?\r
- Carryover to next week?\r
\r
**2. Plan Next Week (25 min)**\r
\r
**Step 1: List All Services Due**\r
- MSA services scheduled\r
- Ad-hoc services sold this week\r
- Emergency/urgent services\r
- Carryover from current week\r
\r
**Step 2: Geographic Route Optimization**\r
\r
**Principle:** Minimize travel time and costs by clustering services geographically\r
\r
**Route Planning Rules:**\r
- Group services by zone (same area same day)\r
- Plan logical routes (avoid crisscrossing)\r
- Consider traffic patterns (leave early for distant sites)\r
- Allocate 30 minutes travel time between nearby sites, more for distant\r
- Maximum 1-3 services per technician per day depending on:\r
  * Service type (inspection faster than refilling)\r
  * Travel distances\r
  * Service complexity\r
\r
**Example Good Route:**\r
- Monday AM: Customer A (Sfax Industrial Zone)\r
- Monday PM: Customer B (Sfax Industrial Zone) + Customer C (nearby)\r
- Travel: Minimal, all in same area\r
\r
**Example Bad Route:**\r
- Monday AM: Customer A (North Sfax)\r
- Monday PM: Customer B (South Sfax, 40km away)\r
- Tuesday AM: Customer C (North Sfax again)\r
- Result: Wasted travel time and fuel\r
\r
**Step 3: Technician Assignment**\r
\r
**Assignment Criteria:**\r
- **Skills match:** Assign based on service complexity and technician competency\r
  * Senior technicians: Complex systems, large facilities, VIP customers\r

- **Refilling:** Replacing the extinguishing agent (powder, CO2, foam, water)\r
- **Recharging:** Refilling + restoring correct operating pressure\r
\r
**When Required:**\r
- After use (even partial discharge)\r
- If pressure gauge shows low pressure\r
- If agent contaminated or expired\r
- As part of scheduled maintenance (annual internal examination)\r
- If seal broken for any reason\r
\r
**Service Location:**\r
- **On-Site:** Accessible locations, customer preference\r
- **Workshop:** Large quantities, complex work, better controlled environment\r
\r
**Safety Critical:** These procedures must be followed exactly. Improper refilling can result in equipment failure in emergency or injury to technician.\r

     * Listen for pressure release (hissing sound)\r
     * Do NOT remove valve yet\r
   - **Method B (Discharge):** \r
     * Squeeze handle/lever to discharge pressure\r
     * Hold until pressure fully released\r
     * **Caution:** Creates dust cloud - respiratory protection critical\r
\r
4. **Verify Depressurization:**\r
   - No hissing sound\r
   - Pressure gauge reads zero\r
   - Safe to proceed\r
\r
---\r
\r
**STEP 2: DISASSEMBLE (5 minutes)**\r
\r
1. **Remove Hose/Nozzle (if attached):**\r
   - Unscrew from valve\r
   - Set aside carefully (avoid damage)\r
   - Inspect hose: If cracked or damaged, note for replacement\r

   - Inspect threads: Not stripped or damaged\r
\r
4. **Clean Valve Assembly:**\r
   - Wipe down external surfaces\r
   - Ensure O-ring groove clean\r
   - Clean siphon tube (blow through to verify clear)\r
\r
---\r
\r
**STEP 4: REFILL WITH POWDER (10-15 minutes)**\r
\r
1. **Select Correct Powder:**\r
   - ABC Powder 30% / 40% / 60% as per customer specification or equipment label\r
   - Check powder certificate (CE certified)\r
   - Powder should be free-flowing (not clumped or caked)\r
\r
2. **Weigh Powder:**\r
   - Calculate required amount:\r
     * Example: 6kg extinguisher = 6kg of powder\r
   - Weigh out exact amount (± 50g acceptable)\r
   - **Better slightly over than under**\r
\r
3. **Fill Cylinder:**\r
   \r
   **Method A - Using Filling Machine (Preferred):**\r
   - Connect filling machine to cylinder opening\r
   - Machine automatically meters and fills powder\r
   - Reduces dust exposure\r
   - Faster and more accurate\r
   \r
   **Method B - Manual Filling:**\r
   - Use wide funnel\r
   - Pour powder slowly (avoid creating dust cloud)\r
   - Tap side of cylinder gently to settle powder (avoid air pockets)\r

   - Ensure tube reaches bottom (not bent)\r
   - Thread valve carefully (start by hand - ensure not cross-threading)\r
   - Tighten with wrench (firm but don't over-tighten)\r
   - **Torque specification:** [Specify if available, or "hand-tight + 1/4 turn"]\r
\r
3. **Reconnect Hose/Nozzle:**\r
   - Attach hose to valve\r
   - Tighten securely\r
   - Verify nozzle attached to hose end\r
\r
---\r
\r
**STEP 6: PRESSURIZE (5-10 minutes)**\r
\r
**Nitrogen Pressurization (Standard Method):**\r
\r
1. **Connect Nitrogen Source:**\r
   - Use regulated nitrogen cylinder (not compressed air - moisture causes clumping)\r
   - Connect filling adapter to extinguisher valve\r
   - Ensure secure connection\r

### CO2 Extinguisher Refilling Procedure\r
\r
**Type:** Carbon Dioxide (CO2)\r
**Sizes:** 2kg, 5kg, 10kg (most common)\r
**Key Difference:** Weight-based (not pressure-based) - weigh to verify fill\r
\r
⚠️ **SPECIAL SAFETY WARNINGS FOR CO2:**\r
- **Cold Burn Hazard:** CO2 is extremely cold (-78°C when released)\r
- **Asphyxiation Hazard:** CO2 displaces oxygen - work in ventilated area\r
- **Pressure Hazard:** Stored at high pressure (~60 bar at 20°C)\r
\r
---\r
\r
#### CO2 Extinguisher Refilling - Step by Step\r
\r
**PREPARATION:**\r
\r
1. **Verify Equipment:**\r
   - Confirm CO2 type (check label)\r
   - Note capacity (kg of CO2)\r
   - Check hydrostatic test date (critical for high pressure)\r
   - Inspect valve: CO2 valves are different from powder\r
\r
2. **Gather Materials:**\r
   - CO2 gas supply (from Air Liquide cylinder or bulk tank)\r
   - CO2 filling equipment:\r
     * Filling hose with appropriate connectors\r
     * Valve wrench\r
     * Precision scale (accurate to ±10g minimum)\r
   - Replacement valve seals if needed\r
   - New safety pin and seal\r
   - New service tag\r
   - **Insulated gloves** (for cold protection)\r
   - Safety glasses\r
\r
3. **Safety Setup:**\r
   - Work in well-ventilated area (preferably outdoors or with exhaust fan)\r
   - Ensure others aware you're working with CO2\r
   - Gloves and safety glasses ON\r
\r
---\r
\r
**STEP 1: DEPRESSURIZE & DISASSEMBLE (5 minutes)**\r
\r
1. **Weigh First (Important):**\r
   - Weigh entire extinguisher as-is\r
   - Record weight\r
   - This tells you how much CO2 is inside\r
\r
2. **Depressurize (if needed):**\r
   - If pressure remains, slowly discharge\r
   - Point away from people\r
   - ⚠️ **Cold Hazard:** Do not touch discharge horn during or immediately after\r
   - Continue until fully depressurized\r
\r
3. **Remove Valve:**\r
   - Unscrew valve using appropriate wrench\r
   - Inspect valve seat and seals\r
   - Replace seals if damaged or compressed\r
\r
---\r
\r
**STEP 2: INSPECT CYLINDER (5 minutes)**\r
\r
☐ **Critical Inspection (CO2 cylinders more vulnerable):**\r
  - Interior walls: No corrosion, pitting, or damage\r
  - Exterior: No dents, bulges, or damage\r
  - Threads: Not damaged\r
  - **Hydrostatic test date:** MUST be within validity\r
    * First test: 10 years from manufacture\r
    * Subsequent: Every 5 years\r
  - **If any doubt about cylinder integrity: DO NOT REFILL - Replace cylinder**\r
\r
---\r
\r
**STEP 3: REFILL WITH CO2 (15-20 minutes)**\r
\r
**CO2 Filling Method:**\r
\r
1. **Setup Scale:**\r
   - Place extinguisher on scale\r
   - Tare (zero) the scale, OR note empty weight from cylinder label\r
\r
2. **Connect CO2 Supply:**\r
   - Connect filling hose to CO2 source (regulated supply)\r
   - Connect other end to extinguisher valve opening\r
   - Ensure connections tight (leaks waste expensive CO2)\r
\r
3. **Calculate Target Weight:**\r
   - Check extinguisher label for "CO2 Charge Weight"\r
   - Example: 5kg extinguisher = 5kg of CO2\r
   - Target total weight = Empty cylinder weight + CO2 charge weight\r
   - Example: If empty cylinder = 8kg, target total = 8kg + 5kg = 13kg\r
\r
4. **Fill Slowly:**\r
   - Open CO2 supply valve\r
   - **Fill slowly** - CO2 liquid fills cylinder, takes time\r
   - Monitor scale continuously\r
   - As weight approaches target, slow down filling (easy to overfill)\r
   - ⚠️ **Cold Formation:** Frost will form on cylinder exterior (normal)\r
   - ⚠️ **Never overfill:** Excess pressure can rupture cylinder as it warms\r
\r
5. **Stop at Target Weight:**\r
   - When target weight ±50g reached, close CO2 supply\r
   - Allow cylinder to warm to ambient temperature (5-10 minutes)\r
   - Frost will dissipate\r
   - Re-weigh: Weight may change slightly as temperature stabilizes\r
   - Adjust if necessary (add or remove small amount)\r
\r
---\r
\r
**STEP 4: REASSEMBLE & SEAL (10 minutes)**\r
\r
1. **Install Valve:**\r
   - Install new seals if old ones compressed\r
   - Thread valve carefully\r
   - Tighten securely\r
\r
2. **Final Weight Verification:**\r
   - Weigh complete assembly\r
   - Compare to nameplate "charged weight"\r
   - **Must be within ±2% of rated weight**\r
   - If under: Needs more CO2\r
   - If over: Slightly over-pressurized (not safe - must correct)\r
\r
3. **Install Pin & Seal:**\r
   - New safety pin\r
   - Tamper-evident seal\r
   - Service tag with date and technician ID\r
\r
---\r
\r
**STEP 5: QUALITY CHECK (5 minutes)**\r
\r
☐ **Weight Verification:**\r
  - Final weight matches specification\r
  - Documented in WAVE PLUS\r
\r
☐ **Valve Check:**\r
  - Securely tightened\r
  - No visible leaks\r

## 4.5 ON-SITE SERVICE EXECUTION METHODS\r
\r
### Overview of Service Execution Models\r
\r
**SS+ offers two primary methods for executing on-site services, based on customer preference, site size, and operational requirements:**\r
\r
**Method 1:** SS+ Collection & Return (We Collect Equipment)\r
\r
**Method 2:** Customer Collection & Delivery (Customer Brings Equipment to Work Zone)\r
\r
The method is determined during service planning and confirmed with customer prior to service day.\r
\r
---\r
\r
### METHOD 1: SS+ COLLECTION & RETURN\r

### CHOOSING THE RIGHT METHOD\r
\r
**Decision Factors:**\r
\r
| Factor | Method 1: SS+ Collection | Method 2: Customer Collection |\r
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------------|\r
| **Site Size** | Small-Medium (1-50 units) | Any size |\r
| **Customer Preference** | Convenience, full service | Cost savings, control |\r
| **Customer Staff Availability** | Not required | Required |\r
| **Site Complexity** | Multi-building, spread out | Centralized, single area |\r
| **Security Requirements** | Escort required | Can minimize SS+ site access |\r
| **Budget** | Higher cost (full service) | Lower cost (reduced service) |\r
| **Relationship** | Build relationship (we do everything) | Collaborative (customer involved) |\r
\r
**Communication During Quotation:**\r
Always present both options to customer:\r
- *"We offer two service methods: We can collect and return all equipment (full service), or if you prefer, your staff can bring equipment to our work zone (reduced cost). Which would you prefer?"*\r
\r
**Documentation:**\r
- Note chosen method in MSA or service agreement\r
- Confirm method before each service visit\r
- Be flexible: Method can change per customer request\r
\r
---\r
\r
### SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\r
\r
**Multi-Day Projects (Extended Duration):**\r
- Work zone remains setup for duration (secure overnight)\r
- Coordinate with customer for security (lock tent, secure equipment)\r
- Equipment collected Day 1, serviced over multiple days, returned final day\r
- OR equipment serviced in batches (collect section 1, service, return; collect section 2, etc.)\r
\r
**Weather Challenges:**\r
- Rain: Postpone outdoor work or require covered area\r
- Extreme heat: Provide shade for technician (tent), hydration, breaks\r
- Cold: Appropriate clothing, consider indoor work zone\r
\r
**Security Concerns:**\r
- High-value customer sites: Coordinate security access\r
- Escorted work: Customer provides escort for collection/return\r
- Equipment tracking: Extra vigilance to ensure no equipment lost/misplaced\r
\r
**Customer Training Opportunity:**\r
- When using Method 2 (Customer Collection), offer brief training:\r
  * How to properly remove equipment from brackets\r
  * How to check equipment condition (basic visual inspection)\r
  * Opportunity to educate customer staff on fire safety\r
